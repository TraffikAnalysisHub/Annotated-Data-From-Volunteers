This research, published in JAMA Network Open, highlights significant disparities in the suspicion of child abuse (SCA) in pediatric cases involving traumatic injuries.\\n\\nConducted by a team at Stanford University School of Medicine, the study analyzed patient data collected from a multicenter retrospective study conducted between 2022 and 2024. The analysis included a total of 634,309 pediatric patients who had complete data, among which 13,579 children were identified as having injuries linked to suspected child abuse. This group consisted of 21.2% Black, 16.9% Hispanic, and 41.8% white children.\\n\\nIn contrast, the subgroup without suspected child abuse mirrored the racial distribution reported in the 2010 U.S. Census, revealing that Black and Hispanic children were disproportionately represented in the SCA group while white children were underrepresented. The study calculated odds ratios of 1.75 for Black children and 1.11 for Hispanic children, indicating a heightened risk of being suspected of abuse compared to their white counterparts.\\n\\nFurthermore, the analysis found that being Black remained an independent risk factor for suspicion of child abuse, even after adjusting for socioeconomic status and hospital characteristics. The odds ratio for Black children was recorded at 1.10, whereas Hispanic ethnicity appeared to offer some protective factors, reflected in an odds ratio of 0.71.\\n\\nAdditionally, the duration of hospital stays for Black children who were suspected of abuse was significantly longer. Specifically, they experienced a 26.5% longer hospital stay for mild to moderate injuries and a 40.1% longer stay for severe injuries compared to white children in the same subgroup.\\n\\nThe authors of the study emphasized the importance of developing a standardized screening tool aimed at reducing unconscious bias in diagnosing non-accidental trauma across various racial and ethnic groups.\\n\\nThis research raises critical questions about the systemic issues contributing to these disparities in child abuse identification and calls for urgent action to address the biases that may affect the treatment and perception of minority children within the healthcare system."}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.711531Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-14T12:12:33.489666Z", "inner_id": 11, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60834, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 144951306, "annotations": [{"id": 54483944, "completed_by": {"id": 60834, "email": "ankitamanna1@gmail.com", "first_name": "", "last_name": ""}, "result": [{"id": "p61THJtkiE", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Incident"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}, {"id": "DUsZ9IuV0x", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Minor", "Physical Abuse/Threat or force"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "coercion_classifier"}, {"id": "pCiCHyPaQT", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "recruitment_classifier"}, {"id": "wkpCaC2bC4", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "transport_classifier"}, {"id": "5rdTM63bEc", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Child Trafficking"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_classifier"}, {"id": "j2rOF72E7W", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_sub_classifier"}], "reviews": [], "history": [{"id": 59683552, "comment": null, "organization_id": 34950, "project_id": 122257, "annotation_id": 54483944, "draft_id": null, "review_id": null, "task_id": 144951306, "result": [{"id": "p61THJtkiE", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Incident"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}, {"id": "DUsZ9IuV0x", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Minor", "Physical Abuse/Threat or force"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "coercion_classifier"}, {"id": "pCiCHyPaQT", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "recruitment_classifier"}, {"id": "wkpCaC2bC4", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "transport_classifier"}, {"id": "5rdTM63bEc", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Child Trafficking"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_classifier"}, {"id": "j2rOF72E7W", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_sub_classifier"}], "lead_time": 771.125, "action": "submitted", "started_at": "2025-02-14T12:12:35.298000Z", "created_at": "2025-02-14T12:25:25.895214Z", "created_by": 60834, "comment_id": null}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-14T12:25:25.750495Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-14T12:25:25.750505Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-02-14T12:17:24.550259Z", "lead_time": 771.125, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 6, "unique_id": "b50bcd9f-7303-441c-bf4e-7ddf83794803", "import_id": null, "last_action": "submitted", "bulk_created": false, "task": 144951306, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60834, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": 60834}], "file_upload": "2d869759-batch_5_data.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "agreement": 100.0, "data": {"_id": {"$oid": "6770bbd76933901ae1d3cbde"}, "text": "Young Man Arrested in Palma for Abusing His Baby The infant sustained injuries requiring treatment in the paediatric ICU at Son Espases Hospital\\n\\nEP Viernes, 27 de diciembre 2024, 15:51 Comenta Necesitas ser registrado para acceder a esta funcionalidad.

Every phone call is evidence: organs are being openly bought and sold,” he told the Chinese edition of The Epoch Times on Dec. 16.\\n\\n“[The ads say], ‘If your matching [organ] isn’t successful, just call this number, and we’ll match you.’ As long as you pay enough, they’ll grab a live person, harvest the organs, and sell them to you,” Du said.\\n\\n“They have an entire organizational system, with doctors and everything… This is large-scale organ harvesting from living people.”\\n\\nThe CCP’s mass killing-for-profit scheme of forced organ harvesting has existed in China as early as the 1990s. The London-based independent China Tribunal in 2019 unanimously concluded that prisoners of conscience have been—and continue to be—killed in China for their organs “on a significant scale.”\\n\\nOver the past two decades, the main victims of forced organ harvesting have been practitioners of Falun Gong, or Falun Dafa, an exercise meditation and spiritual practice based on the tenets of truthfulness, compassion, and forbearance.\\n\\nThis year, the forced organ harvesting issue attracted increased attention, with the first known survivor escaping to the United States and stepping forward.\\n\\n3 Steps to the Truth\\n\\nRegarding the nearly 20-year-long efforts by the Falun Gong community to call for an end to the CCP’s forced organ harvesting, Du said he experienced a three-stage process of understanding what has occurred.\\n\\nThe first stage was disbelief.\\n\\n“As a normal person, I didn’t believe it. Live organ harvesting? No matter what, I couldn’t believe it because this isn’t something a human being would do—it’s something only beasts would do,” he said.\\n\\n“I had heard this story for a long time, [but I still] thought that Falun Gong practitioners were making it up.”\\n\\nFalun Gong practitioners take part in a parade in New York City on May 10, 2024, to celebrate World Falun Dafa Day while calling for an end to the persecution of the spiritual practice in China. The placards they hold raise awareness of the Chinese regime’s state-sanctioned forced organ harvesting, which primarily targets Falun Gong practitioners. Samira Bouaou/The Epoch Times\\n\\nDeath Row Prisoners\\n\\nThe second stage was believing that the CCP harvested organs from death row prisoners.\\n\\nDu spent six years in a detention center, during which he saw 32 individuals walk out of their cells after being sentenced to death. Sometimes, he helped these death row inmates write applications for organ donation.\\n\\nOne day, Du and a death row prisoner were scheduled for a hearing at the same time.\\n\\nDu asked a court officer, “How is the death penalty carried out now? In the past, those sentenced to death by shooting had to pay for the bullets. I heard that now [death penalty] is done by injection. Do they have to pay for the injection?”\\n\\nThe court officer replied that the injection costs 2,800 yuan ($383.65), but now the death row inmate no longer needs to pay.\\n\\nDu asked why. The officer replied that they just inject anesthesia and take the organs, and the person dies, so there is no need for injections anymore.\\n\\n“That’s when I realized there really is such a thing as live organ harvesting,” said Du. “The police clearly told me, don’t think about the organ issue. [They’ll] take all your organs… and there’s no compensation for you. It’s like you’re just giving back to society.”\\n\\nAfter Du was released from prison, he asked an old friend from the court system, who also told him that death row inmates no longer receive the injection.\\n\\n“The forensic doctor contacts a connected hospital, and the doctors just go there to remove the organs. Afterward, [the body] is cremated. The family doesn’t see the body, they’re not allowed to, only the ashes are shown to them.”\\n\\nWealthy Inmates Who Had Transplants\\n\\nThat’s when Du reached the third stage of understanding—he finally believed the CCP was indeed involved in organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners.\\n\\n“I met some wealthy fellow inmates who had undergone organ transplants, mainly liver and kidney transplants. Some spent 3 million ($411,043) yuan, some spent 2 million ($274,029), and the cheapest was 900,000 yuan ($123,313).”\\n\\nDu asked them how they got the transplants, and he was told: “Someone helps you organize it, someone sells the organs, you just pay the money, and don’t worry about anything else.”\\n\\n“The scale might far exceed what outsiders expect because just in one small section of our prison, so many people had liver and kidney transplants,” Du said.\\n\\n“Where did these organs come from? How many were actually donated?” he asked.\\n\\nDoctors carrying organs for transplant surgery at a hospital in Henan Province on Aug. 16, 2012. Screenshot/Sohu.com\\n\\nThe price difference of organs is due to the age difference of the organ sources, based on what Du learned after being discharged from prison.\\n\\n“It’s very simple logic—Falun Gong practitioners’ organs are healthier because they don’t smoke or drink,” he said. “Another factor is age; it’s no good if the person is too young, children’s organs don’t work either. The best organs come from those aged between 16 and 22.”\\n\\nDu added that this creates the problem of “murder on demand.”\\n\\n“If a prisoner’s organ match is successful, regardless of whether their crime is light or serious, they are still sentenced to death,” he said.\\n\\nDu, who also had experience in the media, said a lady told him that after an ovary sterilization surgery, she found that one of her kidneys was missing.\\n\\n“She asked me if I could help. I said this should definitely be reported, and if not, I would contact the media. While discussing this, I asked her to prepare the hospital diagnosis and other materials, but then this person disappeared, and I could never find her again,” he recalled.\\n\\n“This happened last

struck with bull whips, and suffering from small knife cuts.\\n\\nOne child recounted an incident of being struck with a firearm, while another child presented evidence of being shot with a BB gun, as a pellet was discovered lodged in his leg.\\n\\nChere Fielder, the mother, is said to have witnessed the abuse unfold without intervening. Oklahoma has established laws addressing the issue of “failure to protect.”\\n\\n“No one should get off the hook completely for allowing their children to be abused.

The child allegedly provided a false account regarding the circumstances of his injury to protect his parents.\\n\\n“You never know in a situation like this how the caseworker handled the situation, but if the kids are lying, often times they have to go by that,” said Dorman.\\n\\nIn Oklahoma, there is a legal obligation to report any suspected cases of child abuse. This evening, the pair finds themselves in the Cleveland County Jail.\\n\\nA mother is charged with four counts related to enabling child abuse, while the father is facing multiple charges, including four counts of abuse, five counts of sexual abuse, and one count of neglect.\\n\\nReference"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.711591Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-16T16:32:30.946826Z", "inner_id": 14, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60834, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 144951309, "annotations": [{"id": 54571952, "completed_by": {"id": 60834, "email": "ankitamanna1@gmail.com", "first_name": "", "last_name": ""}, "result": [{"id": "4w8FPfDmM8", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Incident"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}, {"id": "jmB7Fx1LH2", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Minor"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "coercion_classifier"}, {"id": "QY5pq3BYEt", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "recruitment_classifier"}, {"id": "1-kxBHB_yB", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "transport_classifier"}, {"id": "R-YzvyQYTg", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Child Sexual Exploitation"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_classifier"}, {"id": "KAh3fS5C_J", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Pornography"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_sub_classifier"}], "reviews": [], "history": [{"id": 59775660, "comment": null, "organization_id": 34950, "project_id": 122257, "annotation_id": 54571952, "draft_id": null, "review_id": null, "task_id": 144951309, "result": [{"id": "4w8FPfDmM8", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Incident"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}, {"id": "jmB7Fx1LH2", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Minor"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "coercion_classifier"}, {"id": "QY5pq3BYEt", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "recruitment_classifier"}, {"id": "1-kxBHB_yB", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "transport_classifier"}, {"id": "R-YzvyQYTg", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Child Sexual Exploitation"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_classifier"}, {"id": "KAh3fS5C_J", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Pornography"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_sub_classifier"}], "lead_time": 1747.076, "action": "submitted", "started_at": "2025-02-16T16:32:32.818000Z", "created_at": "2025-02-16T17:01:39.270260Z", "created_by": 60834, "comment_id": null}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-16T17:01:39.135393Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-16T17:01:39.135402Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-02-16T16:45:09.476815Z", "lead_time": 1747.076, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 6, "unique_id": "5d29fcaa-8989-41b5-aa10-fed514979252", "import_id": null, "last_action": "submitted", "bulk_created": false, "task": 144951309, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60834, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": 60834}], "file_upload": "2d869759-batch_5_data.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "agreement": 100.0, "data": {"_id": {"$oid": "6770bbd76933901ae1d3cbbe"}, "text": "Listen to this article Listen to this article\\n\\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit\\n\\nSuppression of evidence — Private search doctrine\\n\\nUnited States v.

He argues that the court erred in relying on the private search doctrine to deny his motion to suppress evidence that was obtained by a warrantless visual police search of a digital file that he uploaded to his email account.\\n\\nRuling: The Second Circuit affirmed. The court noted that google reported that it contained child pornography because the hash value for the image contained therein matched the hash value that Google assigned an image previously located in another file, which image a Google employee or contractor had visually examined and identified as child pornography. Neither the private search doctrine nor the Google terms of service agreement supports the challenged warrantless search. However, the district court correctly ruled in the alternative that the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule supports denial of the suppression motion because, at the time the authorities uploaded the file, they had a good faith belief that no warrant was required.\\n\\nMelissa A.

The rescued individuals are currently housed in the Elida España welfare center in Guatemala City, where officials aim to ensure their safety.\\n\\nHowever, members of the sect have gathered outside the facility, which is heavily guarded by police, in an apparent effort to regain custody of the children.\\n\\nMembers of Lev Tahor a week after the rescue of the children\\n\\nAccording to Guatemalan authorities, the children and teens were subjected to forced marriages, abuse, and other related offenses while under the sect’s control. Cult representatives told local media that a judge has ordered an investigation and a review within five days, after which a decision will be made regarding the children’s return to their families. They also claimed that around 20 community members have been hospitalized, though it remains unclear whether this includes the rescued minors or protesting adults from the sect.\\n\\nCult members defended their practices in media interviews, citing their \"interpretation of the Bible\" to justify marrying boys and girls as young as 14. Meanwhile, footage shared on social media by sect members shows children being forcibly taken to welfare facilities. One video features an adult handing out fruit to children on a government bus.\\n\\n2 View gallery Welfare workers carry a girl who was rescued from the cult\\n\\nGet the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play : https://bit.ly/4eJ37pE | Apple App Store : https://bit.ly/3ZL7iNv\\n\\nDespite their rescue, some children have reportedly refused assistance, alleging involvement by \"Zionists\" in the operation. A young boy, while being taken into care, shouted at welfare workers: “You’re a Zionist! I won’t go with you. Leave me alone!” Authorities suspect the children were indoctrinated during their time with the sect.\\n\\nGuatemalan Welfare Minister Marvin Rabanales addressed the situation in a media interview, noting that many of the children participated in Hanukkah celebrations at the welfare center alongside their mothers. He described the atmosphere as \"much calmer\" after weeks of tension, adding, \"There was anxiety among community members due to various circumstances, but conditions have significantly improved. We are ensuring all basic needs are met for the families.\"\\n\\n2 View gallery ( Photo: Guatemalan Attorney General of the Nation's Office \\ AFP )\\n\\nLocal officials have reported difficulties communicating with the children, many of whom are unwilling to speak with investigators. In some cases, they were seen resisting authorities during the rescue. Jacob Flitschkin, an American activist who arrived in Guatemala to assist the detained children, has been translating for the authorities from Yiddish. He has also provided food that adheres to the children’s strict dietary rules, such as vegetables and matzo. “I’m here to save children and victims,” Flitschkin stated.\\n\\nDuring the children’s custody, adults from Lev Tahor reportedly communicated instructions to them in Yiddish, encouraging them to hit and bite police officers and welfare workers.\\n\\nA survivor of the sect told local media that the children had been trained to remain silent or scream instead of speaking. “It will take time to break the fear and help them open up about what happened,” the survivor explained. “They’ve been manipulated, and they just need time to regain a sense of normalcy.”"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.711666Z", "updated_at": "2025-01-27T17:15:47.808320Z", "inner_id": 18, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60833, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 144951313, "annotations": [{"id": 53486386, "completed_by": {"id": 60833, "email": "sskanuk@gmail.com", "first_name": "", "last_name": ""}, "result": [{"id": "7crHWND1Vj", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Incident"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}, {"id": "h7Iqqvt089", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Minor", "Physical Abuse/Threat or force", "Sexual Abuse"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "coercion_classifier"}, {"id": "Vm8l02ktkY", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "recruitment_classifier"}, {"id": "XcDtcKj846", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "transport_classifier"}, {"id": "8sN9zgpZcv", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Child Trafficking", "Child Sexual Exploitation", "Sexual Exploitation"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_classifier"}, {"id": "UQuwLUdPj9", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Pornography"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_sub_classifier"}], "reviews": [], "history": [{"id": 58474293, "comment": null, "organization_id": 34950, "project_id": 122257, "annotation_id": 53486386, "draft_id": null, "review_id": null, "task_id": 144951313, "result": [{"id": "7crHWND1Vj", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Incident"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}, {"id": "h7Iqqvt089", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Minor", "Physical Abuse/Threat or force", "Sexual Abuse"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "coercion_classifier"}, {"id": "Vm8l02ktkY", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "recruitment_classifier"}, {"id": "XcDtcKj846", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "transport_classifier"}, {"id": "8sN9zgpZcv", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Child Trafficking", "Child Sexual Exploitation", "Sexual Exploitation"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_classifier"}, {"id": "UQuwLUdPj9", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Pornography"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_sub_classifier"}], "lead_time": 52.782, "action": "submitted", "started_at": "2025-01-27T17:22:08.560000Z", "created_at": "2025-01-27T17:23:01.878023Z", "created_by": 60833, "comment_id": null}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-01-27T17:23:01.697789Z", "updated_at": "2025-01-27T17:23:01.697810Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-01-27T17:22:15.120040Z", "lead_time": 52.782, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 6, "unique_id": "7eed9ef8-9cb2-497a-8216-fb66a41e12b5", "import_id": null, "last_action": "submitted", "bulk_created": false, "task": 144951313, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60833, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": 60833}], "file_upload": "2d869759-batch_5_data.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "agreement": 100.0, "data": {"_id": {"$oid": "6770bbd76933901ae1d3cc01"}, "text": "News Journal/USA TODAY NETWORK\\n\\nPensacola News Journal\\n\\nA U.S. Marine charged with killing a woman and leaving her remains in an Alabama pond allegedly had numerous files depicting child sexual abuse on his cell phone, according to an arrest report.\\n\\nPfc.

Cheek/Unsplash\\n\\n(WIB) – Black children compared to others are most likely to live in poverty, endure the least access to healthcare and experience over-policing. So, it’s heartbreaking to add that they are also the most likely to experience child abuse.\\n\\nHouston, We Have a Problem\\n\\nIn 2023, Defender Managing Editor ReShonda Tate’s article “Black children experiencing brunt of child abuse crisis,” she wrote about a Houston mother beating her 4-month-old daughter because the baby’s father no longer wanted a relationship with her. That article also spotlighted the 7-year-old boy found dead in a washing machine where his adoptive parents reportedly stuffed him after he was beaten, suffocated, and possibly drowned – all because the boy stole the father’s snacks.\\n\\nTate also mentioned those two “severely malnourished” teen siblings who made a daring escape from their Cypress home after suffering unimaginable abuse and horror at the hands of their mother and her younger boyfriend.\\n\\nThough National Child Abuse Awareness Month (April) is months away, the issue remains. And our children are paying the price.\\n\\nThe Prevalence of Abuse\\n\\nAccording to the Department of Health and Human Services, Black children were three times more likely to die from abuse or neglect than white children.\\n\\n“Child abuse occurs within the Black community pretty much at about the same rate that Black people exist in the population, 13%. But it is in the death that results from that child abuse where the numbers are skewed and Black children are far overrepresented,” said psychologist Dr. Norman Fried. “Twenty-five percent of all child abuse cases in America are of Black children. And we know that one in every four Black children by the age of four will be abused, but one in every 10 white children will be abused at that same age range.”\\n\\nGlenn Wayne Smith and Jasmine Ellison were arrested for injury to a child and serious bodily injury after their 5-month-old was allegedly brain dead after abuse over a four-day period. Courtesy Harris County Sheriff’s Office.\\n\\nA whopping 16,000-plus children are involved in child protective services (CPS) cases in Houston, and over 1,000 of those youth were removed from their homes in an emergency, according to Be A Resource.\\n\\nThe Long-Lasting Impact\\n\\nMonica Sanders, regional director for Child Protection Investigations in Harris County, says these children suffer severe and often life-altering impacts.\\n\\n“As a result of their abuse, the abuse they suffer can have lasting consequences and impact them physically, psychologically, behaviorally and cognitively as well.”\\n\\nAbuse is considered an ACE (adverse childhood experience). ACEs harm children’s developing brains so profoundly that the effects show up decades later; they cause many chronic diseases, and most mental illnesses and are at the root of most violence.\\n\\nBrain science shows that, in the absence of protective factors, toxic stress damages children’s developing brains. Stress is the body’s normal response to challenging events or environments. Positive stress — the first day of school, a big exam, a sports challenge — is part of growing up and considered nature.\\n\\nToxic stress, however, can come in response to living for months or years with a screaming alcoholic father, a severely depressed and neglectful mother, or a parent who takes out life’s frustrations by abusing their child physically, verbally or sexually.\\n\\nBlack Parental Views on Discipline\\n\\nOne huge challenge in curbing this abuse is the traditional views on discipline still held onto by many Black parents.\\n\\n“My parents whupped me all the time and look how I turned out,” is a common refrain from the “spare the rod, spoil the child” school of parenting.\\n\\nBut looking at how many Black adults turned out is actually why Millennial and Gen Z parents are less likely to use spanking as punishment.\\n\\nChloe Joseph, a single mother bordering on millennial and Gen Z status, said her childhood was enough to convince her not to spank.\\n\\n“My dad, he just spanked my brother. But me and my two sisters caught pure hell and fury from my mama, Emma Jean,” said Joseph. “But she was seriously depressed and damaged. And she took it out on us. In middle school, I told myself, ‘If I have kids, I will never hurt them like that.’”\\n\\nBut Franklin Stubbs takes another view.\\n\\n“Though it’s not politically correct, I still spank my kids,” he said. “And every time I go shopping and see some little white kids tearing up the entire store, and their parents sitting there looking defeated, I know I’m doing right by my kids. If not, society will beat them worse.”\\n\\nNumbers Problem\\n\\nThough HHS numbers claim Black children are three times more likely than white children to suffer from abuse, the numbers may be significantly skewed.\\n\\nResearch conducted by the Standford School of Medicine shows that Black children are over-reported as suspected victims of child abuse when they have traumatic injuries, even after accounting for poverty. The study also found that injuries in white children are under-reported as suspected abuse. These skewed numbers not only make Black people, in general, look more violent, but they cause additional harm, according to senior study author Stephanie Chao, MD, assistant professor of surgery at Stanford Medicine.\\n\\n“If you over-identify cases of suspected child abuse, you’re separating children unnecessarily from their families and creating stress that lasts a lifetime,” Chao said. “But child abuse is extremely deadly, and if you miss one event — maybe a well-to-do Caucasian child where you think ‘No way’ — you may send that child back unprotected to a very dangerous environment. The consequences are really sad and devastating on both sides.”\\n\\nSolutions\\n\\nAccording to blackchildlegacy.org, strengthening children’s “protective factors” is best. Protective factors are conditions or attributes in individuals, families, communities, or the larger society that, when present, mitigate or eliminate the risk of abuse in families and communities. When present, these protective factors increase the health and well-being of children and families.\\n\\nThe following protective factors are linked to lower incidences of child abuse and neglect and are said to help parents find resources, supports, or coping strategies that allow them to parent effectively, even under stress:\\n\\nAdditionally, Chao and her colleagues are designing more equitable ways to screen injured children for possible abuse. They are creating a universal screening system so evaluation for possible abuse is not initiated primarily by medical providers’ gut feelings and biases. Chao’s system has been in use at Stanford Medicine Children’s Health since 2019.\\n\\nChao is also now working with Epic, the nation’s largest electronic medical record company, to include an automated child abuse screening tool in its system.\\n\\nResources\\n\\nNational Domestic Violence Hotline\\n\\n800-799-7233\\n\\nHouston Police Department Family Violence Unit\\n\\nWebsite:

(KPR) - The Kansas Bureau of Investigation says a Kansas child is on life support at a hospital in Nebraska, after a suspected case of child abuse. The case began Christmas Day when the girl’s parents brought her to the Republic County Hospital in Belleville, Kansas. The unconscious child was then transported to a hospital in Omaha. Hospital staff in Belleville contacted local police, who then contacted the KBI. The pediatrician overseeing the child's care in Omaha says the girl has no brain activity and remains on life support due to severe injuries. No word on any arrests so far.\\n\\n==========\\n\\nState Sales Tax on Food Finally Dropping to Zero\\n\\nTOPEKA, Kan. (TCJ) - The state sales tax on food and groceries will finally fall to zero next week. Grocery bills will get a bit cheaper January 1, when the state sales tax on groceries ticks down from 2% to 0%. The Topeka Capital-Journal reports that the tax cut is the third installment of a gradual elimination of the state's sales tax on groceries that was 6.5% before the Legislature and Governor Laura Kelly approved the tax cut in 2022.\\n\\nThe tax cut is only for the state's share of the food sales tax, and other taxing entities can still levy a sales tax on food.\\n\\nThere is non-qualifying food that will remain at the 6.5% tax rate. Kansans won't pay state sales tax on things like produce, milk, meat, bread, bottled water, soft drinks and dietary supplements, but prepared food won't qualify for the cut.\\n\\nThe Kansas Health Institute said at 6.5%, Kansas had one of the highest sales tax rates on food in the country. On Wednesday, Kansas will be among the 38 states that don't currently tax food. KHI says greater food sales taxes are associated with higher food insecurity rates, changes in purchasing behavior and poorer health outcomes.\\n\\n==========\\n\\nKansas Joins Effort to Save Nation's Grasslands\\n\\nUNDATED (KPR) - Republicans and Democrats from six states, including Kansas, have introduced federal legislation to help save the nation’s grasslands. The North American Grasslands Conservation Act would create a plan and a grant program to protect and restore prairies and sagebrush. Kansas Democratic Congresswoman Sharice Davids is cosponsoring the bill. The Buffalo Nations Grasslands Alliance is one of 50 groups in favor of it. CEO Shaun Grassel says the grants would support controlled burns, for example, which can help to mitigate wildfires. “It’s a great bill,\" he said. \"Tribes will have a say in the national grasslands strategy.” Most of North America’s grasslands are gone - used now for crops or other development.\\n\\nThe bipartisan legislation would put money into saving the nation’s rapidly disappearing grasslands. The Buffalo Nations Grasslands Alliance works with 16 tribes that are trying to conserve land across the Great Plains. More than 50 hunting, farming and conservation groups have also endorsed the bill.\\n\\n==========\\n\\nRetired KU Chemistry Professor Helps Develop Drug to Treat Parkinson's\\n\\nLAWRENCE, Kan. (KNS) - A retired University of Kansas chemist has helped develop a new drug therapy to treat Parkinson’s disease. Valentino Stella worked at KU for more than 40 years. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved seven of his drugs. That includes his most recent, Vyalev, which treats Parkinson’s disease. Unlike other drugs for Parkinson’s, which are taken in doses throughout the day, Vyalev continuously provides medication through a pump. Stella says Parkinson’s disease reduces dopamine levels in the brain, making it difficult for patients to function. The new drug helps keep those levels steady. “So, this is designed to help those patients feel better and be able to function and be around family and be responsive,\" he said. The drug is marketed by AbbVie, a pharmaceutical company.\\n\\nSella says people with Parkinson’s disease experience declining dopamine levels in the brain. Most drugs to boost those levels are taken multiple times a day, but Vyalev is administered continuously through a wearable pump.\\n\\n“It’s in a pump about the size of your cell phone, a little bit deeper but physically it’s about the same size as your cell phone,\" Stella said. \"It essentially sits on your belt.” Stella says he’s proud to help improve the quality of life for people experiencing Parkinson’s.\\n\\n==========\\n\\nPesticide-Free Parks Coming to KC and Elsewhere\\n\\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (HPM) - Several Midwest communities are working with an environmental group to stop the use of certain fertilizers, weed killers and insecticides used in public parks and fields. In Kansas City, the environmental group is trying to phase out certain fertilizers and pesticides at two local parks. Harvest Public Media reports that it's part of a national program, and more cities could soon follow suit. Outdoor spaces that are piloting the program are switching to organic practices that focus on monitoring soil health and enhancing nutrients over the next two years. The project is a partnership with Beyond Pesticides - a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit. Rika Gopinath, who works for the nonprofit, says the goal is to help cities around the country make the switch to improve community and environmental health. “It's a paradigm shift away from chemical landscape management into healthy soils, healthy places and regenerative organic land management,\" he said.\\n\\nAudrey Tran Lam is an environmental health program director at the University of Northern Iowa. She says the program is accessible to small cities. \"No matter what the resources you have at your fingertips, you're able to implement solutions in your parks, your playscapes and your schools... and that is protective of human and public health,\" she said. A children’s park and an outdoor sports complex in Kansas City are the latest additions to the program. Implementation in Kansas City is planned for the spring. And plans are underway to bring the program to other Midwestern cities and states.

(KNS) - Kansas law prohibits landlords from evicting tenants for reporting housing violations. But the law lacks an enforcement mechanism. The Kansas News Service reports that a recent survey suggests many low-income renters fear retaliation from their landlords. The University of Kansas study shows low-income renters will not report poor living conditions because they fear eviction. Some renters in the survey said their landlords have harassed or assaulted them. Wichita City Council member Mike Hoheisel says renters in his community face similar issues. The city has passed an ordinance to enforce the state law. Hoheisel says many renters do not know their rights. And some landlords use intimidation tactics to evict them. “These landlords rely on ignorance of the system in order to move through the process in what I view as an unfair manner,\" he said. The Wichita ordinance can fine landlords for retaliating, and it requires mediation with tenants.

(KNS) - A recent study from a group of sociologists focuses on western Kansas and how humans attempt to control nature. The Kansas News Service reports that the researchers from universities in Kansas and Germany say we live in an era where humans modify their environment. They say a perfect example is western Kansas, where groundwater is used for irrigation to support an entire agriculture system. But with that water running out, Kansans are questioning if the lives they have built will last. Lead author Georg Schaefer says cultural barriers are getting in the way of water conservation. “It's just people who grew up in a culture that doesn't work anymore, and who don't see a way out,” he explained. Schaefer says the region once benefited from the Euro-American culture of progress and innovation. But he thinks that same attitude is slowing water conservation efforts in western Kansas.\\n\\n==========\\n\\nKU Head Volleyball Coach Announces Retirement\\n\\nLAWRENCE, Kan. (KU Athletics) – Ray Bechard, head volleyball coach for the University of Kansas, announced his retirement Friday after leading the program for 27 seasons.

assault. The brutal couple will spend the rest of their lives behind bars. It must be because they subjected their two foster sons to horrific sexual abuse. William Zuluk, 34, and Zachariah Zuluk, 36, were sentenced to 100 years in prison without parole. The pair collaborated with a network of pedophiles to make rape videos. According to the Daily Star, the Zolloks in the US state of Georgia adopted the two children in 2018 when they were five and three years old. The couple portrayed themselves as loving fathers on social media. The mentally ill couple regularly forced their sons to perform sexual acts with them on camera.

Dr. Joe Bonga, who serves in the Refugee Highway Partnership Global Leadership team, said that the Church in Africa has the potential to be a transformative force in addressing the root causes of forced immigration.\\n\\nSpeaking to Christian Daily International, Bonga said that the Church should offer safe spaces, increase programs and opportunities to empower the youth “economically, challenge cultural norms, and strengthen advocacy and action networks within their local communities and country contexts.”\\n\\nHe said that the tragedy of forced displacement and immigration is impacting “a generation of African youth fleeing their homelands in millions in search of safety, dignity, and opportunity…. a tragedy set to double in 2025.”\\n\\nThe UN’s International Organisation for Migration reported that slightly over 250,000 migrants from West and Central Africa arrived irregularly in Italy, Spain, Greece, Malta and Cyprus by sea and land between 2017 and 2023. IOM uses the term \"irregular migrants\" to refer to movement of people that takes place outside the laws, regulations or international agreements to seek asylum which is not illegal but a human right.\\n\\nIn its 2023 report, IOM indicated that 2,191 migrants disappeared while trying to cross the Mediterranean, the Atlantic, and the Sahara Desert between June and July of the same year, mainly linked to drowning, dehydration, or hypothermia.\\n\\nA recent incident off the coast of Italy brought to light the precarious irregular movement of people to Europe from Africa. An 11-year-old Sierra Leonean girl was rescued after clinging to tyre tubes for three days in the Mediterranean. According to a BBC report, rescuers from Compass Collective, an NGO, heard her calls for help while on their way to another emergency.\\n\\nThe unnamed girl said she had set off with 44 people from Sfax, Tunisia but the boat they were in encountered a storm and sank. The rescuers believe all other occupants must have drowned. The girl was found suffering from hypothermia but is expected to recover at least physically from her ordeal.\\n\\nUNICEF reported that at least 289 children are estimated to have died or disappeared attempting to cross the Mediterranean migration route from North Africa to Europe. This equates to nearly eleven children dying or disappearing every week as they search for safety, peace and better opportunities. With over 55,000 children having arrived in Europe in 2023, UNICEF highlights a 58% increase in the number of unaccompanied children.\\n\\nAccording to Bonga, the girl’s account paints a heart-wrenching picture of desperation and tragedy that lays bare the desperation that compels countless young Africans to embark on perilous journeys.\\n\\n“This is not an isolated incident but emblematic of a broader crisis,” said Bonga who acknowledges that while these issues are complex and multifaceted, the role of the Church - historically a cornerstone of African communities - has come under scrutiny as many young people feel abandoned by an institution that once was a beacon of hope, justice, and refuge.\\n\\nWhile economic challenges, persecution, forced marriages, war and conflict and disasters have been the predominant factors driving irregular migration, the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) notes that climate change has now led to some areas becoming unlivable adding to factors contributing to human mobility.\\n\\n“When people are willing to take the risk of crossing the Mediterranean it is a testimony of their desperation. They know that there is a chance they might not survive, and they know they risk being sent back. But with an untenable situation in many of these people’s home countries, with conflict and hunger on the rise, they see no other options,” states an analysis from NRC.\\n\\nRHP and United Methodist Committee on Relief (UMCOR) are some of the ministries and organizations calling for a safe migration pathway. UMCOR recognizes that migrants are children of God and have a right to receive care regardless of their reasons for migrating and is pushing for churches and Christian networks to assist migrants."},

with downloading child pornography from the dark web.\\n\\nThe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in January alerted the Michigan Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force that a person had transferred several images of child porn through their Google email address. The user uploaded the images from a digital device to their Google Photos account, a cloud-based storage service allowing users to store and access files from multiple devices.\\n\\nInvestigators reviewed the reported images and confirmed they depicted minors being sexually abused, according to an affidavit authored by a U.S. Secret Service agent contained in court files.\\n\\nServed with a warrant, Google confirmed the email account belonged to 51-year-old Larry G. Phipps of Merrill. Google’s records showed Phipps emailed several of the illicit images to a Yahoo email account, the affidavit states.\\n\\nInvestigators executed a search warrant on Phipps’ home on July 9. Phipps was present at the time and told Michigan State Police detectives he had downloaded the photos on the dark web and stored them in a password-protected location on his tablet, the affidavit states.\\n\\nOfficials seized a Motorola cellphone and Samsung tablet from Phipps’ bedroom. A forensic review of the devices yielded at least 40 photos of child porn, most of which depicted prepubescent children.\\n\\nPhipps in 2011 pleaded no contest to one count of third-degree criminal sexual conduct-incest in Branch County Circuit Court. A judge in November 2011 sentenced Phipps to 95 months to 15 years in prison, with credit for 109 days already served. The judge noted he exceeded Phipps’ advisory guidelines as they did not account for Phipps exposing his 13-year-old victim to HIV, court records show.\\n\\nThe victim in that case told police she had walked in on Phipps watching porn and he then proceeded to assault her. She said Phipps had done this before in another state, according to reporting from The Daily Reporter.\\n\\nPhipps’ conviction required him to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life.\\n\\nThe Michigan Department of Corrections paroled Phipps in June 2019 and discharged him from it two years later.\\n\\nPhipps on Dec. 19 had his initial appearance before U.S. District Magistrate Judge Patricia T. Morris, who informed he had been charged with single counts of transportation of child pornography and possession of child pornography. The former charge is punishable by 15 to 40 years in prison, while the latter is punishable by 10 to 20 years.\\n\\nMorris ordered Phipps held in custody pending trial, the date of which is

out for help\\n\\nALJAZEERA\\n\\nSometimes when the pain hits, Agnes* has to pause for several seconds to ride out the excruciating wave. It feels like someone has tied a rope to her insides and is pulling and twisting it, the 27-year-old Nigerian domestic worker says, making it hard to bend or stand up straight.\\n\\nAgnes’s ordeal started in March in the Iraqi city of Basra when her boss raped her at gunpoint. She fell pregnant, and the man then forced her to undergo a painful abortion. It was so difficult, Agnes said, that she could not sit for three days. Since then, the severe abdominal pains won’t go away, and there’s no one to take her to a hospital.\\n\\n“I just want to go home and treat myself, but I can’t do that,” Agnes said on a phone call from Basra, where she is holed up in a hostel belonging to the recruiting firm that hired her from Nigeria last year. “The man has refused to pay my salary. I don’t know if I am pregnant, but I have not seen my menstruation since then. I just want to go home and check myself and see what’s happening inside me,” she added, her voice breaking.\\n\\nAl Jazeera is not mentioning Agnes’s real name because she fears reprisals from the staff of the so-called recruiting agency. She is one of hundreds, if not thousands, of people who are caught in a transnational labour network that often sees women from Nigeria and other African countries deceived into domestic servitude in Iraqi cities, activists said.\\n\\nIn Nigeria, the women are hired by a ring of local “agents” who sell them a dream of good pay and good conditions abroad. They get the women to agree, process visas and send them off to recruitment firms in Iraq for a commission of about $500 per woman, according to activists familiar with the system.\\n\\nOnce there, the Iraqi firms ask the women, called “shagalas” (meaning “house worker” in Arabic), to sign two-year contracts and assign them to families or labour-intensive institutions like spas, where they are often expected to work more than 20 hours a day for monthly pay of $200 to $250. In many homes, the women are subject to inhumane treatment: They go days without food, are beaten and are not provided living quarters.\\n\\nSome, like Agnes, also face sexual abuse and rape. Several women told Al Jazeera stories of victims who had faced so much abuse and torture that they ended up dead although these cases have not been independently confirmed.\\n\\n“It’s a form of modern slavery,” said Damilola Adekola, co-founder of Hopes Haven Foundation, a Nigerian NGO that helps track women in Iraq and other Middle Eastern countries where abuse of African domestic workers is rife. “These Iraqi agents and the families [the women work for] often tell them, ‘We’ve bought you, so you have to work.’ The contracts they sign go against any type of international law because there’s no medical care and they have to work obscene hours.”\\n\\nThese women often lack knowledge of what a normal workplace should be like because the Nigerian recruiters target women from rural communities who are usually uninformed about the dangers, Adekola added. Although some have diplomas, they often don’t know about the realities of post-war Iraq or that Baghdad is not a country. “Once they hear they can get on an airplane, they just jump at the opportunity,” he said.\\n\\nA native of Nigeria’s Ekiti, a small state northeast of the commercial capital, Lagos, Agnes was working as a domestic worker at home when she heard of an opportunity that could take her abroad.\\n\\nShe paid 100,000 naira ($64) to a local recruiting agent, a family friend whom she trusted, believing that she would be able to make much more money to send home to her ailing mother and nine-year-old son.\\n\\nSoaring inflation in Nigeria has crippled the naira since 2019. The result has been that Nigerians, young and old, are leaving the country to seek better opportunities. According to an Afrobarometer report this month, more than half of the 200 million population indicated they want to leave the country due to economic hardship with most looking at Europe, North America and the Middle East.\\n\\nFor Agnes, domestic work anywhere else and with the promise of pay that was three times what she normally earned, was an answered prayer. She left for Basra from Lagos airport in September 2023 and arrived at the Iraqi recruitment firm she had been “sold” to after a day’s journey.\\n\\nOnce in Iraq, Agnes’s dreams of a comfortable life abroad turned into a nightmare. Her first shock was at the recruitment firm in Iraq. The firm assigned her a first home to work at, but Agnes was badly treated. She wasn’t given food regularly although her boss would force her to work all day, and her phone was seized, she said. When she complained and refused to work, the Iraqi man returned her to the agents, demanding a refund. Angered that she’d caused a loss, two employers from the firm descended on Agnes, she said, hitting her, punching her and smashing her mobile.\\n\\n“I had to use a bandage on my eye for three days,” Agnes said. In a photo taken days after the beating and seen by Al Jazeera, Agnes’s right cheek is red and swollen. The firm then forced her to go to a second home, which is where she said the rape took place.\\n\\nNow, Agnes is back in the firm’s hostel, penniless. After the pains in her abdomen rendered her unable to work, she said the boss who raped her abandoned her there and refused to pay six months of her salary.\\n\\n“If I knew what this country is like, I wouldn’t have come here. If I knew it’s not safe and there is no respect for life, I wouldn’t have come. I just thought I could also come here and hustle. Please help me get out of here,” she pleaded.\\n\\nAlthough she has a place to sleep and she, as well as dozens of women at the hostel, get some noodles and rice daily to cook, Agnes is fearful. The agency has refused to send her back to Nigeria, insisting that she has one more year to work on her contract, despite her debilitating pain.\\n\\nAgnes said she tries not to aggravate staff of the firm to avoid beatings. Several women there have either been beaten or have been locked up for days without food because their bosses complained of their conduct, she said. Al Jazeera is not revealing the name of the company in order to protect the women, but we did seek official responses regarding the firm from the Iraqi Ministry of Interior, which is in charge of Iraq’s police. We have not yet received a response.\\n\\nDespite several laws against labour trafficking, the practice is rife in post-war Iraq. The country is both a source and destination country for trafficked victims with an estimated 221,000 people currently in slavery-like conditions, according to a November report from the International Organization of Migration (IOM). Most documented victims are from Iran and Indonesia.\\n\\nThe experiences of African female domestic workers in Iraq are largely undocumented, but the challenges they face have been going on for years. Black people have historically been seen as slaves in the country and still face discrimination today.\\n\\nIn 2011, news reports documented how dozens of Ugandan women were tricked by local agents into believing they would be working on United States army bases when the country was under American occupation after the fall of Saddam Hussein’s government. Instead, the women were “sold” to Iraqi firms for about $3,500 and forced to work in dire conditions. Eventually, some escaped with the help of US army staff, but others were never accounted for.\\n\\nSimilar cases of exploitation are being reported across the Middle East, where hundreds of thousands of migrant workers from African and Asian countries are at higher risk of trafficking, according to the IOM.\\n\\nUnder the “kafala” system, which is legal in countries like Lebanon, employers pay for the documentation and travel costs of the foreign workers and use that as leverage to abuse them by confiscating their passports or seizing their pay, reports have shown. The system doesn’t give the worker the right to seek out another employer but does allow employers to transfer contracts to others. Recruitment agencies often use the legal system to employ many workers and then auction the contracts online for huge amounts of money.\\n\\nIt’s unclear to what extent Iraqi authorities investigate agents hiring and “selling” African workers or the individuals who maltreat these women. Authorities however appear to be investigating one case that has garnered widespread attention on Nigerian social media.\\n\\nEniola, 28, had, like her counterparts, jumped at the opportunity to earn more money abroad as a domestic worker and arrived in Baghdad in February 2023. However, her boss forced her to work most of the day and allowed her only three to four hours of sleep. When she complained, the woman routinely tortured her with tasers or hit her with an iron rod. She doused her with hot tea or water on several occasions too.\\n\\nIn videos Eniola sent to Al Jazeera, her fingers, which appear to be broken, are bandaged, and scars from burns and wounds dot her body. She found the courage to finally escape in August after more than a year of abuse. Al Jazeera is only using Eniola’s first name to protect her identity.\\n\\n“She had just beat me when she put some water on the fire and told me to enter the bathroom,” Eniola told Al Jazeera. She feared her boss wanted to pour hot water on her, so she fled. “I don’t know where I got the courage, but I ran outside.”\\n\\nBleeding, Eniola ran to groups of locals who, shocked by her wounds, helped her get to a police station where she handed herself in. She was never paid by her boss.\\n\\nIn a statement, Iraq’s interior ministry told Al Jazeera it was not aware of the two women’s cases, but vowed to investigate the matter.\\n\\nAn officer at the country’s Directorate for Residence Affairs in charge of residency violations, and where Eniola has been transferred, told Al Jazeera the abusive boss had been “invited by government agencies for questioning and was bieng investigated”.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, Eniola confirmed she was arraigned in court alongside her former boss, and a years’ worth of salary was handed to her. Eniola, only willing to go home, said she declined to press charges against the Iraqi woman. Authorities plan to force the boss to pay for her ticket home, she said, but it’s unclear when that will happen.\\n\\nThere are several other Nigerian women in detention for various offences: fighting with their bosses, overstaying their residence permits or “taking salaries and running away,” said the Iraqi official, who is not authorised to speak to the press.\\n\\nNigerian domestic workers Al Jazeera spoke to however say their Iraqi bosses have been known to take advantage of language barriers and some wrongfully accuse the women of crimes.\\n\\nNigeria fails to act quickly, activists say\\n\\nActivists blamed Nigerian authorities for failing to regulate the industry and allowing groups of women to head to Middle Eastern countries for domestic work without proper documentation or a system to track them. Some reports also accuse staff of the Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS) of taking bribes from local agents and turning a blind eye at airports to clear cases of exploitation.\\n\\nAl Jazeera put these allegations to the NIS via email. In a statement, the NIS said it would respond to the accusations but did not reply in time for publication.\\n\\n“Immigration is never a crime, and we are not saying people should not find work abroad, but there should be a government system where these women are registered and taxed, even if it’s a small token,” Adekola of the Hopes Haven Foundation said. The organisation helped alert authorities to Eniola’s and Agnes’s cases.\\n\\n“With that, the government can monitor the women’s information and work situation.

On December 23, a man named Gnanasekaran sexually assaulted the student, filmed her, and threatened her. A case was registered, the FIR copy of which was uploaded to the Tamil Nadu police website and made available for public view. Usually, cases of sensitive nature cannot be accessed or viewed by the public.\\n\\nGreater Chennai City Police Commissioner A Arun said that the FIR details would normally be ‘automatically’ locked in the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network Systems (CCTNS) and attributed technical glitches in the transition from the Indian Penal Code (IPC) to the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) for delay in the automatic locking, creating room for the leak. A case has since been registered at the Kotturpuram police station to identify the source of the leaked FIR, Arun said.\\n\\nBefore going into what exactly happened in the case, let us see what CCTNS is and what is the standard police procedure in a complaint of sexual violence.\\n\\nCCTNS and procedure after a police complaint is filed\\n\\nLaunched by the Indian government in 2009, CCTNS is a nationwide networked infrastructure for capturing, storing, and sharing data related to crimes and criminals in real-time. The system integrates police stations and other law enforcement agencies, between which there can be data access and collaboration. People can also register their FIR online and track the status of their case online.\\n\\nSo, here is what happens when a complaint is filed: the concerned police officer inquires about the matter and registers an FIR to record the information about the crime and set the criminal law in motion. This is done to obtain and record as much early information as possible about the alleged criminal activity before it is forgotten.\\n\\nOnce the FIR is filed, a copy of it should be delivered to the complainant – be it the survivor or those who filed the complaint on behalf of the survivor – free of cost. The accused or their representative are also eligible for a copy within two days of their application to the police.\\n\\nThe FIR copy, unless the crime is sensitive in nature – such as sexual offences, offences pertaining to insurgency, terrorism, or offences under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act – should be uploaded on the police website within 24 hours of the registration of the FIR. This is in accordance with a Supreme Court order in 2016. The top court said that the decision not to upload the FIR copy on the website cannot be taken by an officer below the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police/Assistant Superintendent of Police. And this decision should be duly communicated to the concerned jurisdictional magistrate.\\n\\nThen comes the technical part. After registering the FIR, it has to be uploaded on the CCTNS platform. For this, the officer-in-charge of the police station should select the ‘Publish’ or ‘Unpublish’ option. On clicking ‘yes’ to Publish, the FIR becomes available on the police website for viewing and downloading by the public. For offences that are sensitive in nature, the police officer has to click the Unpublish option, which will hide the FIR from public view.\\n\\nWhat happened in the Anna University case?\\n\\nOn the night of December 23, a woman student of Anna University was spending time on the campus with her boyfriend when she was sexually assaulted by a man. The accused, Gnanasekaran, held her in illegal custody for 40 minutes, filmed her with her boyfriend, threatened her, and then blackmailed her.\\n\\nThe same day, the survivor and a professor from the university’s Prevention of Sexual Harassment (PoSH) team filed a police complaint, leading to the registration of an FIR. Gnanasekaran was identified and arrested the next day. Soon after, allegations of his links to the DMK emerged as several pictures of him with party functionaries were posted on social media.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the FIR was uploaded on the Tamil Nadu police website. This was a huge breach of privacy of the survivor, as the FIR contained her name, address, and other identification details. Further, the FIR was also criticised for slut-shaming the woman for spending time with her boyfriend.\\n\\nChennai Commissioner Arun explained that the FIR had been filed exactly as per the survivor’s statement and said that the police are obligated to replicate the survivor’s words without alteration. “Typically, FIR details for certain crimes such as POCSO and women-related offences are automatically locked in the CCTNS. But now that there is a transition from IPC to BNS, a technical issue may have caused a delay in locking the FIR,” Arun said. He added that it might have been downloaded from the website or obtained from the complainant’s side.\\n\\nHe said that leaking the FIR and debating about the FIR in such sensitive cases is an offence. “Disclosing the survivor’s identity is an offence, so it is being investigated as a separate case by the Kotturpuram police. Action will be taken against those who leaked the identity,” he said.\\n\\nNeed for guidance to survivors\\n\\nThe FIR also included details that were irrelevant to the sexual assault. Vidya Reddy who works at Tulir – Centre for Prevention and Healing of Child Sexual Abuse in Chennai, told TNM, “Apparently the intimacy being shared by the couple was mentioned in the FIR. This is not at all relevant to the FIR, which should stick to the context and details of the sexual assault. If the girl was sexually assaulted, why were these unnecessary details needed?”\\n\\nShe also added that there is a certain diffidence when it comes to anything related to sex, sexual violence in particular. “Although sex is a powerful drive, we are always trying to marginalise it. This failure has led to a warped understanding of sexual violence for stakeholders in the criminal justice system, including health respondents. This discomfort and inhibition often impinges on capturing the enormity of the context of sexual violence – visceral elements like yelling, pushing, violence of threats used, and emotional damage caused. By failing to articulate the experience in its entirety, we fail to understand what the victim has gone through.”\\n\\nStating that the survivor’s complaint letter should be fully reflected in the FIR without any embellishment of “ingredients”, Vidya pointed out that survivors often need guidance to write a complaint, because of the possible effects of the trauma. It is crucial that an independent Support Person who is trauma informed and can navigate the criminal justice system assists the survivor articulate the violence for the record. Officers who have been specially oriented about the dynamics of sexual violence, rape trauma syndrome, and PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder] should be assigned in such matters.”\\n\\nAnanthakrishna, a criminal advocate and former Additional Public Prosecutor of the Madras High Court, said that the FIR leak might have been a human error. Underscoring the importance of victim confidentiality, particularly in serious offences like those under the POCSO Act, he said, “The victim’s name is not disclosed publicly to prevent further trauma and to encourage others to come forward. While the FIR might include the survivor’s identity, this information must remain confidential.”\\n\\nAcknowledging that there were human and systemic flaws, he noted, “Human errors in uploading or handling FIRs can occur. Also, the change in laws from IPC to BNS could have resulted in this error. Such mistakes should be addressed without exaggerating them. Police officers should be sensitised in such matters. However, I want to stress that such instances should never recur.”\\n\\nVidya, however, raised a crucial question. “If the FIR leak was due to a technical glitch caused by transitioning from IPC to BNS, it then begs the question – have details of all sexual violence cases since July been leaked?” she asked."}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.711872Z", "updated_at":

Piece\\n\\nSyerleena’s statement sheds light on the lack of accountability among digital platforms, which has allowed the proliferation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and other online risks.\\n\\n“Social media platforms, gaming communities, and even educational apps have turned into gateways for harm,” she asserted, emphasising the dire consequences of inaction in a Bernama report published in the Malay Mail.\\n\\nThis lack of regulation is compounded by predators exploiting anonymous profiles and unmonitored spaces, underscoring the need for stricter oversight.\\n\\nMalaysia’s proposed move to license social media services, effective January 1, 2025, is seen as a pivotal step toward ensuring that platforms prioritise user safety and actively combat the spread of CSAM.\\n\\nOperation “Op Pedo”: A Stark Reality Check\\n\\nThe integrated operation “Op Pedo” conducted by the Royal Malaysia Police (PDRM) and the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) has brought the gravity of the issue into sharp focus.\\n\\nThe findings highlight an urgent need for government-led interventions to prevent digital predation and safeguard children’s well-being.\\n\\nAs part of its effort, Malaysia will enforce a licensing system under the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998 (Act 588).\\n\\nThis regulation mandates all social media and Internet messaging services with over eight million Malaysian users to apply for a Class License.\\n\\nFailure to comply could result in legal action.\\n\\nThe Moral Imperative: Protecting the Future\\n\\nSyerleena’s rallying cry is not just directed at policymakers but also at society at large.\\n\\nShe called on Malaysians to remain vigilant and report any suspicious online activities involving CSAM, underscoring that protecting children is a shared responsibility.\\n\\n“We must push for immediate and comprehensive reforms to ensure these platforms are held accountable for the content they host,” she said.\\n\\n“Protecting children is not just a collective responsibility; it is a moral imperative that demands immediate and decisive action.”\\n\\nImplications for Brands and Platforms\\n\\nFor marketers and digital platform operators, this regulatory shift signals a new era of accountability.\\n\\nSocial media companies must rethink their approach to content moderation, user safety, and compliance.\\n\\nWhile stricter regulations may increase operational costs, they also present an opportunity for brands to position themselves as champions of ethical digital practices.\\n\\nMarketing with Purpose\\n\\nThis push for reform is a clarion call for brands to prioritise trust and safety in their digital strategies.\\n\\nBy actively supporting child protection initiatives, brands can not only comply with regulations but also build deeper, more meaningful connections with their audiences.\\n\\nAs Malaysia takes this significant step toward a safer digital space, the responsibility rests on every stakeholder—government, corporations, and individuals—to create an internet that truly serves its users.\\n\\nFor marketers, the question is no longer whether to act but how fast they can adapt to a landscape where safeguarding children is the ultimate measure of accountability.\\n\\n\\n\\nMARKETING Magazine is not responsible for the content of external

{"_id": {"$oid": "6770bbd76933901ae1d3cb01"}, "text": "Washington: The US Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) has released its annual report, detailing ongoing human rights abuses in Tibet under the rule of the Chinese government.\\n\\nThe report sheds light on the continued suppression of Tibetan religious, cultural, and ethnic rights, focusing on severe restrictions on Tibetan Buddhism, the disproportionate targeting of Tibetans in political detentions, and the role of international corporations in facilitating Chinese state repression.\\n\\nThe CECC report highlights the persistent crackdown on Tibetan religious practices, particularly Tibetan Buddhism, in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) and other Tibetan-inhabited areas.\\n\\nChinese authorities have maintained strict bans on Tibetan religious ceremonies and limited access to monasteries, especially during significant cultural and religious events. Despite calls for dialogue, Chinese officials have shown little interest in resuming negotiations with the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism, with the last round of talks occurring in January 2010.\\n\\nThe report also points to the systematic efforts by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to impose its \"sinicization\" policy on Tibet, aiming to restrict Tibetan cultural expression and replace Tibetan Buddhist practices with state-controlled versions of religion.\\n\\nThis includes the forced relocation of monks from monasteries, such as the monks of Atshog Monastery in Dragkar (Xinghai) County, due to a planned hydropower project, as well as the creation of residential boarding schools that undermine the intergenerational transmission of Tibetan culture and language.\\n\\nThe CECC report further underscores the disproportionate targeting of Tibetans in the Chinese state's political repression, with Tibetans making up a significant portion of political prisoners in China. Of the 2,764 political prisoners in the CECC's database, 1,686 are known or believed to be detained for reasons related to their religious or cultural affiliations.\\n\\nTibetan Buddhists represent the largest religious group in this database, with 678 detainees affiliated with Tibetan Buddhism. This reflects the ongoing effort by the Chinese government to quash Tibetan religious and cultural identity.\\n\\nThe report further reveals that out of the 1,693 active detentions with available ethnic information, nearly half 790 are ethnically Tibetan. This disproportionate number of Tibetan detainees underscores the continuing ethnic and cultural repression faced by the Tibetan people under Chinese rule.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe CECC report also highlights the role of U.S. and foreign corporations in facilitating China's human rights abuses. One of the key points raised in the report is the involvement of Thermo Fisher Scientific, whose DNA sequencers were allegedly used by Chinese police in Tibet and Xinjiang to compile extensive DNA databases of Tibetans and Uyghurs. The commission expressed concern that this technology could potentially be used for organ harvesting, an accusation that has long been levelled against the Chinese government, particularly regarding Uyghur Muslims.\\n\\nThe involvement of international companies in such human rights violations, the CECC warns, may inadvertently contribute to China's broader campaign of surveillance, control, and repression of ethnic and religious minorities.\\n\\nThe report draws attention to the large-scale protests that erupted in February 2024 in Derge County, Tibet, in response to a planned hydropower dam on the Drichu (Jinsha) River. Locals fear the dam will flood villages and monasteries, including the historic Wontoe 1 Monastery, known for its well-preserved 13th-century murals.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe report also condemned the Chinese government's displacement plans in Derge and other Tibetan areas, emphasising the lack of meaningful community participation in these decisions. These forced relocations and the destruction of Tibetan sacred sites exemplify a broader trend of environmental and cultural destruction in Tibet as Chinese authorities push forward with infrastructure projects, including several other hydropower dams.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnother key finding in the CECC report is the Chinese government's continued efforts to replace Tibetan with Mandarin Chinese in the region.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOfficials have increasingly adopted the term \"Xizang\" the Mandarin term for Tibet in English-language communications, part of a broader strategy to reshape the narrative surrounding Tibet's status and history in global discourse. This move, the report argues, is part of the CCP's strategy to reinforce its sovereignty over Tibet and erase Tibetan cultural and linguistic identity.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe CECC's 2024 report paints a bleak picture of the ongoing suppression of Tibetans by the Chinese government. It documents not only the severe restrictions on Tibetan religious practices and cultural rights but also highlights the complicity of international corporations in facilitating Chinese human rights abuses. The report also underscores the disproportionate targeting of Tibetans in political detentions and the broader effort by the Chinese state to erase Tibetan cultural and religious identity.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe report's findings underscore the urgent need for global attention and action to protect Tibet's unique cultural heritage and the rights of its people."}, "meta": {},

sending a clear message: in Paraguay, violence against our children will not be tolerated under any circumstances, the head of State went on.\\n\\nAs per the new legislation, sexual abuse through sexual intercourse with children under 10 years of age will entail a minimum penalty of 15 to 20 years' imprisonment, which may be extended to 30 years depending on the seriousness of each case. In addition, the measure seeks to expand legal protection for victims of child sexual abuse by describing new forms of violence.\\n\\nThese modifications are very deep and it is not a mere elevation of penalties, there were many legal loopholes and issues that were in an imprecise way and now the child is put in the first place and we seek to avoid impunity. Now we put it at the forefront of the law, expressed Deputy Childhood Minister Eduardo Escobar pointed out in a radio interview.\\n\\nIt is a very hopeful day because the State gave a clear and strong signal that sexual abuse and punishable acts against children are intolerable for Paraguayan society and for the State. This increase in punishment is more than that because of the changes introduced to Paraguay's Penal Code, he also noted.\\n\\nIn addition, the definition of coitus was modified, not limiting it only to penis-vagina penetration, and includes all types of carnal access by anal, oral, or with the introduction of bodily members or objects by some of the first two ways. We close that possibility so that the defense of sexual aggressors has no tool to be able to slip away from justice, Escobar mentioned.\\n\\nThe bill also contemplates aggravating circumstances, such as biological kinship or being the child's caregiver or guardian. It is also an aggravating circumstance to have taken advantage of a relationship of superiority, affinity with the family, or state of vulnerability of the minors is the case for example a school bus driver. The new regulation includes sexual abuse by technological means, known as grooming, which up to now carried low penalties around 3 years in jail. All possible hypotheses were contemplated, Escobar insisted."}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.711959Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-11T04:50:15.948793Z", "inner_id": 35, "total_annotations": 2, "cancelled_annotations": 0,

sentenced to prison for allegedly sexually abusing a girl.\\n\\nWesley Dale Widner, 41, was originally arrested for second-degree sexual abuse, and he later entered an Alford plea – not admitting guilt but stipulating he would likely be found guilty at trial – to a lesser charge of third-degree sex abuse as part of an agreement with prosecutors.\\n\\nOn Dec. 20, he was sentenced to up to 10 years in prison with credit for time served. A restraining order in the case was extended for five years.\\n\\nAuthorities allege Wesley Widner let a girl climb on him while he was naked and allowed her to touch his penis, according to court records.\\n\\nHis spouse, Jay Nicck Widner, 30, was also arrested in the case for allegedly allowing the abuse, and trial is tentatively set for January. Jay Widner is also awaiting trial for child endangerment charges for allegedly striking the girl and threatening to kill her in 2023.\\n\\nIn the fall of 2024, the Iowa Court of Appeals upheld the termination of Jay Widner’s parental rights to three children. The appellate court rulings only identify the parents and children by their initials.\\n\\nJay Widner, the biological mother who identifies with “he/him/his” pronouns, came to the attention of the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services for allegedly causing a black eye and bruising on one of the children as part of physical discipline.\\n\\nFollowing that, Jay Widner allegedly refused services offered by the department, records state.\\n\\nCourt records state one of the children indicated Jay Widner withheld food because the child was being naughty, and Jay Widner also allegedly told one of the children he didn’t love her and only keeps her because he needs disability money for car payments.\\n\\nThe mother also allegedly told a therapist he was “upping” the abuse to get the child taken away.\\n\\nRecords state the couple also confessed to engaging in oral sex and fondling in front of one of the children.\\n\\n'Behind the 8 ball': How research is trying to catch up on

"6770bbd76933901ae1d3cb28"}, "text": "SOUTH BEND — Former South Bend Police officer Timothy Barber, convicted of child seduction, resigned from duty before being terminated by the city of South Bend for his felony charges.\\n\\nIn conjunction with his charges, Barber was ordered to four years of probation, to register as a sex offender and not have contact with children outside of his family. Barber was sworn into the South Bend Police Department in 2019. The Tribune was unable to learn if, after his conviction, Barber was able to retain his pension.\\n\\nAs of Dec. 13, Barber was also decertified as a sworn officer in the State of Indiana, which also serves as a notice nationwide, Timothy Horty, executive director of the Indiana Law Enforcement Academy, told The Tribune. The 16-year-old girl involved is now suing Barber and the city of South Bend. Her identity has been kept confidential.\\n\\nAccording to the city's discipline matrix, finalized on July 6, 2020 — two years before Barber's Sept. 9, 2022, sentencing — Barber's felony conviction was a level six violation, which should have resulted in his termination. Rather, Barber's resignation from the department was accepted by the Board of Public Safety on Sept. 21, 2022. The Tribune previously reported that the police department said in a statement they would \"take action to terminate\" if Barber is found guilty.\\n\\nBarber, however, told The Washington Post in a June 17 article, \"Ex-South Bend officer faces decertification after Post sex abuse investigation,\" that “he received a call from the city telling him to resign or he’d have to go through an internal affairs investigation.\" The Tribune reached out to Barber on Dec. 24 but did not receive a response from him by that evening.\\n\\nMore: Heller's critiqueRevised discipline 'matrix' for South Bend police released\\n\\nThe Tribune contacted South Bend Board of Public Safety board member Darryl Heller, who served on the board at the time of Barber's resignation and in the past critiqued the city's discipline matrix, calling the level of discretion given to the chief of police a \"slippery part of the matrix\" because it \"pushes it back into a realm of subjectivity and we should all be at least aware that that’s happening,\" he said June 18, 2020.\\n\\nIn regard to the board's decision to accept Barber's resignation rather than terminate him, Heller responded by email saying, \"I think the simple answer is that terminating an officer, which involves not only the Board of Public Safety, but also the FOP, is a more complicated legal process than accepting a resignation. The offer and acceptance of a resignation, which doesn’t require Board of Public Safety approval, circumvents embarrassment of the department and the individual. I think it is the Chief’s prerogative to accept it or not.\"\\n\\nHeller referred a reporter to Board of Public Safety legal counsel Danielle Weiss. Weiss referred The Tribune to a city of South Bend spokesperson.\\n\\nA city spokesperson responded on Dec. 20 citing Indiana code 36-8-3-4(n) in the Board of Public Safety statute that says, \"If the member is subject to criminal charges, the board may place the member on administrative leave until the disposition of the criminal charges in the trial court. Any other action by the board is stayed until the disposition of the criminal charges in the trial court.”\\n\\nDuring a Sept. 9, 2022, hearing, Barber was sentenced and the case was considered decided, \"which is also when we determined a 'conviction' occurred,\" a city spokesperson said by email. A sentencing hearing had been set for Aug. 29, 2022, but was continued because Barber had tested positive for COVID at that time, the spokesperson said.\\n\\nAccording to the city and Board of Public Safety minutes, Barber submitted his resignation on Sept. 15, 2022, and it was approved at the monthly board meeting on Sept. 21, 2022.\\n\\n\"Official action wouldn’t have been available to take until 9/21/22,\" a city spokesperson said by email. \"Since he had already resigned by then, the BPS was unable to take action to terminate him. The City cannot discipline or fire someone who is no longer employed.\"\\n\\nEmail Tribune staff writer Camille Sarabia at csarabia@gannett.com."}, "meta": {}, "created_at":

Apollo Quiboloy from running for senator in the 2025 elections.\\n\\nIn a resolution made public on Friday, the Comelec en banc denied the motion filed by senatorial aspirant Sonny Matula in which he argued that Quiboloy’s candidacy “mocks the electoral process” and that the previous ruling exposes “glaring inconsistencies” in electoral candidates.\\n\\nThe en banc dismissed it, citing a “lack of merit” and emphasizing that “there was no valid ground raised in motion.”\\n\\nArticle continues after this advertisement\\n\\n“We find no cogent reason to depart from the Assailed Resolution of the Commission (First Division). The arguments raised by Petitioner in his Motion were already thoroughly passed upon and incisively examined by the Commission (First Division),” the resolution read.\\n\\n“At the outset, the combination of different remedies and prayers in a petition to declare as a nuisance candidate or disqualification or cancellation of a certificate ground is a ground for summary dismissal, and this is clearly and explicitly mandated by Our rules. Even if this procedural defect is brushed upon, We find the ruling of the Commission (First Division) to have sufficiently addressed and discussed the substantive issues thoroughly and exhaustively,” it added.\\n\\nThe motion for reconsideration stems from Comelec’s denial of a petition to disqualify Quiboloy from the 2025 senatorial race and have him declared a “nuisance” candidate.\\n\\nREAD: Comelec junks DQ case vs Quiboloy\\n\\nQuiboloy, the founder of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ and a long-time ally of the Dutertes, is currently facing child abuse and human trafficking cases before the Quezon City and Pasig City courts, respectively.\\n\\nApart from his cases in the country, Quiboloy is also facing several criminal charges in the US, including Conspiracy to Engage in Sex Trafficking by Force, Fraud and Coercion, and Sex Trafficking of Children; Sex Trafficking by Force, Fraud, and Coercion; Conspiracy; and Bulk Cash Smuggling."}, "meta": {}, "created_at":

{"_id": {"$oid": "6770bbd76933901ae1d3cb6c"}, "text": "Queensland Police are under fire for prosecuting a childcare manager accused of leaking information about Australia’s worst-ever paedophile, while failing to act on complaints about the child sex predator dating back 15 years.\\n\\nYolanda Borucki, 60, was last week found not guilty of one count of “using a restricted computer without the consent of the Uniting Church to cause detriment” in Brisbane Magistrates Court, with the verdict raising questions over why she was ever charged in the first place.\\n\\nMs Borucki was accused of accessing confidential records about colleague Ashley Paul Griffith, 46 – who was sentenced to life in jail in November after pleading guilty to hundreds of child sex offences against dozens of children in his care – and sending them to a reporter with Channel Nine’s A Current Affair.\\n\\nShe told the program that Griffith was seen kissing a little girl at a Brisbane childcare centre run by the Uniting Church in October 2021, but police dismissed the complaint along with another from a mother in April 2022, and never searched his home or seized his devices.\\n\\nGriffith was able to return to work where he then raped a little girl at that centre before being made redundant and going on to sexually abuse at least three more little girls after finding work at other daycare centres.\\n\\nThe years of horrific abuse came after police almost instantly dismissed a 2009 complaint that Griffith had sexually abused a little boy at a childcare centre. When he was eventually caught Australian Federal Police officers found thousands of images and videos of him committing unspeakable acts against children in his care.\\n\\nBut after the interview aired the church filed a complaint, and four armed detectives from Queensland Police’s child exploitation squad raided Ms Borucki’s home, seized her devices, and charged and aggressively prosecuted her during a year-and-a-half-long ordeal where she faced the prospect of a maximum sentence of 10 years’ jail.\\n\\nLast Friday she was cleared when Magistrate Kerrie O’Callaghan dismissed the charge, finding that the prosecution had failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Ms Borucki had used the computer, and had failed to prove that she did not have permission to send the emails, or that harm was caused.\\n\\nAfter the verdict Ms Borucki’s lawyers called her actions “heroic” and slammed the police and the church, with defence counsel Ron Belahu saying the case should never have been brought, “let alone pursued so vigorously by the church and police”.\\n\\n“She has suffered immeasurably through the prosecution process and is now obviously very relieved,” he said.\\n\\n“She looks forward to any inquiry conducted by the authorities to shed light on how Australia’s worst paedophile was permitted to work with children for such a long period and into those who enabled this to occur.”\\n\\nPolice said they laid the charge after a computer hacking complaint from the Uniting Church, but a church spokesperson said it took no action other than reporting a privacy data breach, and claimed it “was not a party to the criminal proceeding”.\\n\\nDefence lawyer Jason Murakami wrote to police prosecutors ahead of the trial urging them to drop the charges as it was not in the public interest for the case to continue against Ms Borucki, who had no criminal record, The Australian reported.\\n\\n“The public interest in this matter is understandably remarkable. But not at our client’s conduct. Rather, at how Mr Griffith was able to commit his offending for so long,” he wrote.\\n\\nAfter the verdict he said: “Today’s decision vindicates my client. However, it does not vindicate the behaviour of the Uniting Church Queensland and the resulting prosecution.\\n\\n“My client has had to endure 18 months of emotional stress, psychological torment and extreme financial detriment all because she made the decision to take steps to protect children and those steps embarrassed others.”\\n\\nMs Borucki told A Current Affair that she was “relieved” at the outcome and hit back at false accusations she was paid by the program, saying she only wanted to “disclose how broken is the police system in this country”.\\n\\n“Unfortunately … I don’t feel like a winner, because so many children being hurt and so many families’ lives was destroyed,” she said.\\n\\n“My heart is going straight to them, and my thinking is always what more should be done to actually stop him earlier.”\\n\\nHeader image: Left, Ashley Paul Griffith.

an Alaska resident who initially reached out to law enforcement to report another individual sharing child sexual abuse material (CSAM), now faces his own serious charges. A recent search of his devices revealed a disturbing reality: O’Connor possessed both real and AI-generated child sexual abuse material, blurring the lines between the digital and the deeply harmful.\\n\\n“Real” Images Found Alongside AI-Generated Content\\n\\nO’Connor’s story begins with a seemingly commendable act. He contacted authorities about an airman who had shared explicit images with him. However, during the investigation, law enforcement, with O’Connor’s consent, searched his own devices. The results were chilling.\\n\\nInvestigators uncovered evidence suggesting O’Connor had offered to create virtual reality child sexual abuse material for the airman. This included explicit depictions of a minor child, with O’Connor even using a disturbing code word – “cheese pizza” – to refer to these horrific creations. He proposed building a virtual environment where he could digitally place the child into explicit scenarios, all for a chillingly casual price of $200.\\n\\nThe discovery of real child sexual abuse material alongside the AI-generated content painted a darker picture. O’Connor admitted to unintentionally downloading real images while seeking out AI-generated ones, revealing a disturbing pattern of consumption and a disturbing lack of empathy for the real victims behind these images. Despite reporting some instances of CSAM to internet service providers, he acknowledged deriving sexual gratification from both real and AI-generated content.\\n\\nA search of O’Connor’s home yielded further evidence. Investigators found a computer in his room and multiple hard drives concealed within a home vent. An initial examination of his computer revealed a 41-second video depicting the horrific act of child rape.\\n\\nConcerns over the Rise of AI-Generated CSAM\\n\\nThis case underscores a growing concern: the rise of AI-generated child sexual abuse material. While AI technology offers incredible potential, it can also be weaponized to create hyperrealistic and disturbing images of child sexual abuse. These aren’t just pixels; they represent real children, their innocence violated in the digital realm. Experts warn that AI-generated CSAM is far from victimless. Real images of real victims are often intertwined with AI-generated content, creating a disturbing cycle of exploitation and abuse.\\n\\nIncreased Law Enforcement Action\\n\\nThe Justice Department has intensified its efforts to combat this emerging threat. In May 2024, a Wisconsin man was arrested for using AI software to generate thousands of realistic images of prepubescent children, marking a significant step in law enforcement’s response to this evolving challenge.\\n\\nO’Connor faces serious charges. The U.S. Attorney’s office in Alaska is prosecuting the case, and a federal judge has ordered his detention pending further legal proceedings.\\n\\nThis case serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of the digital age. While technology offers incredible possibilities, it also creates new avenues for exploitation and abuse. The urgent need for collaboration between law enforcement, technology companies, and the public is clear. We must work together to protect children from the shadows of online abuse, both real and digitally created."}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.712045Z", "updated_at":

Sudan since the outbreak of war in mid-April 2023, and it seems the world doesn’t really care.\\n\\nAccording to United Nations reports, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia has recruited approximately 200,000 mercenaries in its brutal campaign against Sudan. Sudan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs filed a formal complaint to the United Nations Security Council, accusing the United Arab Emirates (UAE) of backing the RSF with mercenaries to further its own expansionist interests.\\n\\nIt shall be recalled that Canadian Member of Parliament Garnett Genuis brought attention to the Sudanese crisis and the UAE’s backing of the RSF, as he raised concerns over Canada’s arms trade with the UAE, urging his country to ensure that its weapons are not used to harm Sudanese civilians.\\n\\nIn Parliament, Canada’s Foreign Minister emphasised that the RSF would likely falter without UAE support, linking UAE involvement in African conflicts to ongoing instability in the region.\\n\\nDespite these condemnations, the international response to the RSF’s atrocities has been limited, even as credible reports from international agencies document widespread violations, including genocide, ethnic cleansing, sexual violence, forced displacement, and the destruction of hospitals, places of worship, and public infrastructure. There is growing demand for the RSF to be designated a terrorist entity, for its supporters to be pressured, and for concrete actions to end the violence.\\n\\nAl Hakika, the first publication focused on documenting RSF crimes, has compiled extensive evidence, including accounts of mass killings, bombings, sexual enslavement, looting, and attacks on healthcare workers. Reports also highlight the looting of humanitarian aid and the obstruction of food supplies to displaced persons. Sudan’s Attorney-General, Fateh Tayfour, reported 966 cases of sexual violence and slavery by the RSF, noting that many incidents likely went unreported due to social stigma.\\n\\nThe National Human Rights Commission received thousands of complaints against the RSF, and several cases have resulted in legal action, including capital punishment. Some women have shared harrowing stories of sexual assault, abductions, and beatings by RSF fighters. One woman recounted how RSF soldiers broke into her home and assaulted her daughters. Other women have described widespread abuse, including forced marriages and sexual exploitation, particularly among displaced women and girls.\\n\\nWomen’s rights organisation SIHA has documented forced marriages and the abduction of pregnant women and girls by the RSF, further exacerbating the suffering of vulnerable populations. As the conflict continues, many women and girls are subjected to sexual violence as a means of survival under the dire humanitarian conditions.\\n\\nThe scale of violence perpetrated by the RSF highlights the urgent need for a robust international response, including accountability for those responsible, and comprehensive support for the victims of this ongoing crisis.\\n\\nIn October 2024, humanitarian organisations like Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), the World Food Programme (WFP), and UNICEF had to grapple with shocking situations where their trucks and employees sustained attacks and looting while carting critical medical supplies and food supplies to victims of the war, especially the elderly, women and children in refugee camps in various locations in Sudan, in complete violation of the Geneva Conference agreements on ensuring safe corridors for humanitarian aid delivery.\\n\\nIn addition to preventing food and other relief items from entering refugee camps by imposing blockades, the RSF has set up checkpoints on specific routes as part of a broader strategy to create food shortages, forcibly displacing local populations.\\n\\nArtillery attacks by RSF forces have killed over 5,000 civilians, according to the latest estimates. These artillery attacks target indiscriminately residential areas, refugee camp, villages, marketplaces in Al-Thawrat, Umbada, Old Omdurman, North Darfur, and elsewhere.\\n\\nAttacks have not spared hospitals, healthcare facilities and medical personnel either. On 17th October 2024, the Sudanese Ministry of Health issued a strong condemnation against such egregious violations of international laws and norms. The Sudanese Doctors’ Network and the Sudanese Doctors’ Union have equally raised their voice to condemn these acts.\\n\\nThe Secretary-General of the National Council for Child Welfare, reported that 150 children who were fighting in the ranks of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) were detained during the battles in the capital in October 2024.\\n\\nAcross the conflict-affected states, a total of 1,200 children have been detained and are now under the care of the army’s child welfare unit. Officials explain that these children would undergo rehabilitation in collaboration with UNICEF, the Red Cross, and the Red Crescent before being returned to their families.\\n\\nDespite national and international laws prohibiting child recruitment, it is evident that the RSF continues to recruit children, often offering financial incentives to lure them into camps in Khartoum, Kordofan, Sennar, and Darfur. Currently, 8,000 children are enlisted with RSF forces.\\n\\nAnother disturbing crime committed by RSF forces was against the church. Coptic Archbishop, Sevine Wasfi has revealed that the RSF militia has exhumed graves in churchyards, searching for gold.\\n\\nThe question is: Till when will the world remain visibly unconcerned while torture and death befall women, youth and persons with disabilities in RSF detention centres?"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.712062Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-07T16:23:51.675451Z",

reporting any suspicious persons who may use the opportunity of the celebration to lure, recruit and traffic their children and wards for sexual or labour exploitation.\\n\\nBinta made the appeal in Abuja while speaking at the end-of-the-year Thanksgiving programme organized by the NAPTIP Christian Fellowship.\\n\\nAccording to the Press Officer for NAPTIP, Vincent Adekoye in a Statement, the Director General also urged Officers of the Agency and all stakeholders to imbibe the spirit of unity, love, and religious tolerance which capture the real essence of the Season.\\n\\nBinta Adamu Bello who expressed gratitude to the President and Commander in Chief, His Excellency, Bola Ahmed Tinubu for his unwavering support to the Agency in the realization of its mandates, the Federal Ministry of Justice under the watch of the Honourable Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Prince Lateef Fagbemi also thanked the National Assembly for its legislative backing in the past years.\\n\\nAccording to her, “Christmas is all about love, giving, and unity. So, while celebrating in this season, let us remember that we are all created by God Almighty. Let us work in unity and love without any division.\\n\\n“It is also important to advise all parents and stakeholders across the Country that while celebrating in our various towns, villages, and Communities, let us be vigilant and keep an eye over our children and wards. We should not forget that this is the period when traffickers come around with their ill-gotten wealth and deceive people.\\n\\n“I am therefore appealing to our community leaders to report any suspicious movement or activities to NAPTIP. Our reporting platforms are all active and we shall respond to such reports. Let us unite and say no to human trafficking.\\n\\n“On our part, we shall continue to work hard through the implementation of various counter-trafficking policies and initiatives, through massive enlightenment and awareness creation, through rescue, counseling, and rehabilitation of victims of human trafficking and violence against persons as well as diligent prosecution of traffickers, to outsmart these organized criminal elements.\\n\\n“We thank the President and Commander in Chief, His Excellency Bola Ahmed Tinubu, for his sustained support to the fight against Human Trafficking in the Country, our supervising Ministry, the Federal Ministry of Justice under the leadership of the Honourable Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Prince Lateef Fagbemi, SAN, as well as the National Assembly for their unwavering legislative support.\\n\\n“Human traffickers are enemies of this generation and we must unite, share information and collaborate to defeat them,” the

when she met a man online who she thought was around her age. However, she later found out he was 35.\\n\\nShe came into contact with the predator in an AOL chat group. Even though parental controls were on the computer, the man got into a chat room with Blackwell and her friends.\\n\\nBlackwell decided in the summer of 1999 to move the relationship from the computer to the real world.\\n\\n\"I had spoken to this person, and we had decided to meet up,\" Blackwell told 1819 News. \"He told me that he drove, so I knew he was at least 16, and he asked if he could take me to lunch and then go shopping, and I was like, 'Oh, okay, that works for me.\"\\n\\nShe spent the night at a friend's house and didn't tell her parents she had plans to meet a boy.\\n\\n\"He said, 'I have to do something first before we go do anything,' and I was like, 'Okay,\" she remembered. \"And so he pulled into a motel on Troy Highway.\"\\n\\nIt was in that motel where the man took advantage of the young teen. She said she was scared and didn't know what to do. She didn't tell her parents what happened until she was an adult.\\n\\nLast week, Blackwell ran across a Facebook post that brought back all those horrible memories. Thanks to Covenant Rescue Group, an organization that fights human trafficking and child exploitation, the man was arrested by Dothan Police for doing the same thing earlier this year.\\n\\nAfter years of searching sex offender registries and looking for her abuser, Blackwell said she hopes to pursue charges now that she has his full name and location. She fears that the perpetrator has multiple victims. A quick search of the suspect showed he was also arrested in 2014 in another undercover prostitution sting.\\n\\nBlackwell said now that her daughter is about to be 13, she has a renewed sense of urgency in her quest for justice. But if nothing else, she hopes her story serves as a warning to others so that no more children are hurt.\\n\\n\"So, at the end of it all, if I don't get justice for myself, at least I will know that he can't do it again,\" Blackwell said. \"There's just so many bad people out there. I mean, he was a scary guy, but when you're talking to someone online, and you couldn't see their face or anything back then – but when you're talking to somebody at a young, vulnerable age like that, you're at a place where you're trying to find yourself and where you exist in the world and who you are.\"\\n\\nCovenant Rescue Group works with law enforcement agencies to train and conduct child exploitation strings and rescue operations.\\n\\nTo connect with the author of this story or to comment, email erica.thomas@1819news.com.\\n\\n﻿Don't miss out!

idea to have the same material on your own devices. Or to further consent to a search so law enforcement can gather more information. But that is allegedly what one Alaska man did. It landed him in police custody.\\n\\n404 Media reported earlier this week on the man, Anthaney O’Connor, who ended up getting himself arrested after a police search of his devices allegedly revealed AI-generated child sexual abuse material (CSAM).\\n\\nFrom 404:\\n\\nAccording to newly filed charging documents , Anthaney O’Connor, reached out to law enforcement in August to alert them to an unidentified airman who shared child sexual abuse (CSAM) material with O’Connor. While investigating the crime, and with O’Connor’s consent, federal authorities searched his phone for additional information. A review of the electronics revealed that O’Connor allegedly offered to make virtual reality CSAM for the airman, according to the criminal complaint.\\n\\nAccording to police, the unidentified airman shared with O’Connor an image he took of a child in a grocery store, and the two discussed how they could superimpose the minor into an explicit virtual reality world.\\n\\nLaw enforcement claims to have found at least six explicit, AI-generated CSAM images on O’Connor’s devices, which he said had been intentionally downloaded, along with several “real” ones that had been unintentionally mixed in. Through a search of O’Connor’s home, law enforcement uncovered a computer along with multiple hard drives hidden in a vent of the home; a review of the computer allegedly revealed a 41-second video of child rape.\\n\\nIn an interview with authorities, O’Connor said he regularly reported CSAM to internet service providers “but still was sexually gratified from the images and videos.” It is unclear why he decided to report the airman to law enforcement. Maybe he had a guilty conscience or maybe he truly believed his AI CSAM didn’t break the law.\\n\\nAI image generators are typically trained using real photos; meaning pictures of children “generated” by AI are fundamentally based on real images. There is no way to separate the two. AI-based CSAM is not a victimless crime in that sense.\\n\\nThe first such arrest of someone for possessing AI-generated CSAM occurred just back in May when the FBI arrested a man for using Stable Diffusion to create “thousands of realistic images of prepubescent minors.”\\n\\nProponents of AI will say that it has always been possible to create explicit images of minors using Photoshop, but AI tools make it exponentially easier for anyone to do it. A recent report found that one in six Congresswomen have been targeted by AI-generated deepfake porn. Many products have guardrails to prevent the worst uses, similar to the way that printers do not allow photocopying of currency. Implementing hurdles at least prevents some of this behavior."}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.712129Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-07T18:11:50.661153Z", "inner_id": 45,

Commission on China (CECC) noted the continued violations of human rights in Tibet under Chinese authority.\\n\\nWith a focus on harsh limitations on Tibetan Buddhism, the disproportionate number of Tibetans in political detentions, and the part played by multinational corporations in aiding Chinese state repression, the report illuminates the ongoing suppression of Tibetan religious, cultural, and ethnic rights.\\n\\nThe ongoing suppression of Tibetan religious activities, especially Tibetan Buddhism, in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) and other Tibetan-inhabited regions is emphasized in the CECC report.\\n\\nParticularly during important religious and cultural festivals, Chinese authorities have restricted access to monasteries and strictly prohibited Tibetan religious rites. The previous session of meetings took place in January 2010, but Chinese authorities have not been particularly interested in restarting talks with the exiled spiritual head of Tibetan Buddhism, the Dalai Lama, despite demands for dialogue.\\n\\nThe study also highlights the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) concerted attempts to impose its “sinicization” strategy on Tibet, which aims to censor Tibetan cultural expression and substitute state-run religious traditions for Tibetan Buddhism.\\n\\nThis includes the establishment of residential boarding schools that jeopardize the generational transmission of Tibetan culture and language, as well as the forced relocation of monks from monasteries, including the monks of Atshog Monastery in Dragkar (Xinghai) County, as a result of a planned hydropower project.\\n\\nGiven that Tibetans make up a significant percentage of political detainees in China, the CECC study emphasizes the disproportionate targeting of Tibetans in the Chinese state’s political repression. 1,686 of the 2,764 political prisoners included in the CECC database are thought or known to have been held because of their cultural or religious affinities.\\n\\nWith 678 inmates identified as Tibetan Buddhists, they make up the biggest religious group in this database. This illustrates the Chinese government’s continuous attempts to suppress Tibetan culture and religious identity.\\n\\nNearly half (790) of the 1,693 current detentions for whose ethnic data is available are Tibetan, according to the study. The Tibetan people continue to experience ethnic and cultural persecution under Chinese authority, as seen by the disproportionate number of Tibetan inmates.\\n\\nThe U.S. and international firms’ participation in supporting China’s violations of human rights is also highlighted in the CECC study. The report’s main concerns center on Thermo Fisher Scientific’s purported usage of DNA sequencers by Chinese authorities in Tibet and Xinjiang to create vast databases of Tibetan and Uyghur DNA. This technology may be utilized for organ harvesting, a charge that has long been made against the Chinese government, especially with reference to Uyghur Muslims, the panel said.\\n\\nThe CECC cautions that foreign corporations’ complicity in these human rights abuses might unintentionally support China’s larger effort to monitor, regulate, and suppress ethnic and religious minorities.\\n\\nThe documentary highlights the massive demonstrations against a proposed hydroelectric project on the Drichu (Jinsha) River that broke out in Derge County, Tibet, in February 2024. Residents worry that the project would flood monasteries and communities, including the famous Wontoe 1 Monastery, which is renowned for its intact paintings from the 13th century.\\n\\nThe absence of significant community involvement in the Chinese government’s plans for relocation in Derge and other Tibetan communities was also criticized in the study. As Chinese authorities go on with infrastructure projects, including many more hydroelectric dams, these forced relocations and the destruction of Tibetan holy places are examples of a larger pattern of environmental and cultural destruction in Tibet.\\n\\nThe Chinese government’s ongoing attempts to replace Tibetan with Mandarin Chinese in the area are another important finding in the CECC study.\\n\\nAs part of a larger plan to change the way the world talks about Tibet’s status and history, officials have been using the Mandarin name for Tibet, “Xizang,” more and more in English-language communications. The study contends that this action is a component of the CCP’s plan to obliterate Tibetan cultural and linguistic identity and strengthen its control over Tibet.\\n\\nThe 2024 report from the CECC presents a dismal image of the Chinese government’s continued repression of Tibetans. It details the harsh limitations on Tibetan religious and cultural rights as well as the involvement of multinational firms in supporting Chinese violations of human rights. The research also highlights the Chinese government’s larger attempt to eradicate Tibetan cultural and religious identity, as well as the disproportionate targeting of Tibetans in political detentions.\\n\\nThe report’s conclusions highlight how urgently international attention and action are needed to save Tibet’s distinctive cultural legacy and its citizens’ rights."}, "meta": {},

child pornography. Henry Joseph Rupinski, 53, received his sentence on December 20, 2024, in Calvert County Circuit Court.\\n\\nCredit: Calvert County Sheriff's Office\\n\\nSentence Details\\n\\nJudge Mark S. Chandlee imposed the sentence, which includes strict conditions upon Rupinski’s release. After serving 18 months, he will be placed on five years of supervised probation. Additionally, he is required to register as a sex offender for life, forfeit all electronic devices involved in the crime, and have no unsupervised contact with children.\\n\\nInvestigation Background\\n\\nThe case began in January 2023, when Maryland State Police investigators initiated an online probe into the BitTorrent file-sharing network. During the investigation, Rupinski was found to have allegedly shared a file containing child pornography. A search warrant for his electronic devices uncovered numerous illicit images, leading to his arrest and subsequent prosecution.\\n\\nProsecution and Legal Outcome\\n\\nThe case was handled by Senior Assistant State’s Attorney Rebecca N. Cordero, who presented evidence leading to Rupinski’s conviction and sentencing. The prosecution emphasized the severity of the crimes and the necessity of long-term safeguards to protect the community.\\n\\nCommunity Impact\\n\\nThis sentencing reflects Maryland’s commitment to addressing crimes involving child exploitation. Law enforcement and prosecutors continue to employ advanced technology and investigative methods to track and prosecute offenders involved in such cases.\\n\\nPublic Awareness and Reporting\\n\\nAuthorities encourage individuals to report any suspected child exploitation to law enforcement. Community vigilance is critical in safeguarding children and preventing similar offenses.\\n\\nLike this: Like Loading..."}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.712164Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-07T18:47:50.819063Z", "inner_id": 47, "total_annotations": 2, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60834, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 144951342, "annotations": [{"id": 53463277, "completed_by": {"id": 60832, "email": "iorwuesesolomon@gmail.com", "first_name": "Fanen", "last_name": "Iorwuese"}, "result": [{"id": "sJd1pgZ6l6", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Article"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}, {"id": "mLFJ1dbJLw", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["False Promises/Deception", "Psychological Abuse/Threat or Force", "Sexual Abuse"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "coercion_classifier"}, {"id": "xI8cI7-mMR", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Face-2-Face False Job Promise", "Financial Inducement", "Online Grooming"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "recruitment_classifier"}, {"id": "dHdL8yI5Hx", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "transport_classifier"}, {"id": "gStCJGPpop", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Child Sexual Exploitation", "Sexual Exploitation"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_classifier"}, {"id": "qlr42PMGZQ", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Online Sexual Exploitation", "Personal Sexual Servitude", "Prostitution/Brothel/Escort Agency"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_sub_classifier"}], "reviews": [], "history": [{"id": 58444330, "comment": null, "organization_id": 34950, "project_id": 122257, "annotation_id": 53463277, "draft_id": null, "review_id": null, "task_id": 144951342, "result": [{"id": "sJd1pgZ6l6", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Article"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}, {"id": "mLFJ1dbJLw", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["False Promises/Deception", "Psychological Abuse/Threat or Force", "Sexual Abuse"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "coercion_classifier"}, {"id": "xI8cI7-mMR", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Face-2-Face False Job Promise", "Financial Inducement", "Online Grooming"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "recruitment_classifier"}, {"id": "dHdL8yI5Hx", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "transport_classifier"}, {"id": "gStCJGPpop", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Child Sexual Exploitation", "Sexual Exploitation"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_classifier"}, {"id": "qlr42PMGZQ", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Online Sexual Exploitation", "Personal Sexual Servitude", "Prostitution/Brothel/Escort Agency"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_sub_classifier"}], "lead_time": 260.654, "action": "submitted", "started_at": "2025-01-27T09:56:42.347000Z", "created_at": "2025-01-27T10:01:05.153756Z", "created_by": 60832, "comment_id": null}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-01-27T10:01:04.979982Z", "updated_at": "2025-01-27T10:01:04.979996Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-01-27T09:57:29.420207Z", "lead_time": 260.654, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 6, "unique_id": "52e049bf-3953-4c57-a40f-02d1cdad5139", "import_id": null, "last_action": "submitted", "bulk_created": false, "task": 144951342, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60832, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": 60832}], "file_upload": "2d869759-batch_5_data.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "agreement": 100.0, "data": {"_id": {"$oid": "6770bbd76933901ae1d3cba4"}, "text": "Action4Canada (A4C) will be back in Court soon, but for an entirely different reason. It seems that a drag performer didn’t like what the group was saying about him. The Plaintiff, Tyson Cook, filed a defamation lawsuit in Kelowna on December 19th. It listed the organization, 3 named Defendants, and 1 unidentified Defendant.\\n\\nIn addition to seeking damages, it’s clear that an Injunction will be sought to take the postings down, and to prevent future ones from going up.\\n\\nUnlike the train wreck the group filed in August 2021, this suit is short, to the point, and well written. It spells out exactly what has been said and done.\\n\\nTo be clear, this isn’t a defence of drag performances in general. However, people REALLY need to be careful about what they publish on the topic, since it can result in lawsuits.\\n\\nAccording to the Notice of Civil Claim, or NOCC, the content published by Action4Canada goes far, far beyond criticizing Cook for being a performer. The postings quoted are still available online.\\n\\nIt makes accusations that he:\\n\\nis a pedophile\\n\\nsexualizes children\\n\\nexploits and abuses minors\\n\\nis a sexual deviant\\n\\nindoctrinates children\\n\\nis connected to a rise in child pornography and sexual abuse\\n\\nperforms sexually explicit content in the presence of children\\n\\npromotes self-harm, murder, and cannibalism to children, and/or\\n\\nis an inappropriate role model for children\\n\\nThe content is still up on the Action4Canada website today.\\n\\nIn one such publication from last year, A4C posts his photo along with allegations of specific sexual offences.\\n\\n20… The following sections provide the categories of offences tending to sexually exploit and corrupt the morals of minors, and/or make available or promote, sexually explicit material or activities: Section 151, 152, 153 (1), 163.1, 171.1(5), 172.1(1), 173 (2), 174 (1), 175(1) (see attachment). These are indictable offences liable to imprisonment.\\n\\nAlthough the sections of the Criminal Code of Canada are listed, the actual offences are not specified in the Claim. Here they all are.\\n\\ns.151: Sexual interference s.152: Invitation to sexual touching s.153(1): Sexual exploitation s.163(1): Child pornography s.171.1(5): Making sexually explicit material available to child s.172.1: Luring a child s.173: Indecent acts s.174: Nudity s.175: Causing disturbance, indecent exhibition, loitering, etc.\\n\\nIt’s rather baffling that A4C would post such content, which explicitly accuses him of child sex crimes, but not expect a lawsuit in response. One has to wonder if A4C genuinely believed this to be the case, why not call the police?\\n\\nWhat About Bringing An Application To Strike?\\n\\nRule 9-5 of Civil Procedure for British Columbia does allow for Applications to Strike if a NOCC hasn’t been pleaded properly. That is, of course, what happened with A4C’s previous 391 page suit.\\n\\nThat’s not the case here though. The entire NOCC is just 17 pages, including the covers. It clearly spells out the expression which is being sued upon, who made it, and when. It’s explained why Cook finds it defamatory. Whether or not it can be proven at Trial is another question, but it won’t be struck.\\n\\nWhat About An Anti-SLAPP Application?\\n\\nFor reference, B.C. does have the PPPA, or the Protection of Public Participation Act of 2019. It’s based heavily on the Ontario model, and it written in an almost identical manner.\\n\\nNote: This isn’t legal advice, just commentary.\\n\\n(1) The Defendant must convince the Judge the expression is of public interest. If this is done, the burden shifts to the Plaintiff to do 3 things:\\n\\n(2a) Convince the Judge that the case has substantial merit.\\n\\n(2b) Convince the Judge that there’s no likely defence.\\n\\n(2c) Convince the Judge that the public interest in allowing the case to proceed to greater than the public interest in protecting the expression.\\n\\nIt may be a very hard sell for A4C to persuade that these kind of accusations are of public interest. But even if they do, it’s far from over. The case clearly has substantial merit (2a) — he’s called a pedo, among other things — and a Judge will very likely prefer that Cook get his day in Court (2c). The only possible defence here would be one of truth, if it can be established.\\n\\n[1] Rainbow Alliance Dryden et al. v. Webster. This Ontario case involved comments about “groomers”, which was found to not be public interest speech, among other flaws. That Judge rejected “fair comment” as a defence, dismissed an anti-SLAPP Motion and allowed the case to proceed.\\n\\nThat case also had EGALE Canada acting as an Intervenor. It’s not too farfetched to think that they’ll also try to get involved with Cook and A4C.\\n\\n[2] Teneycke v McVety, is an Ontario case which saw the anti-SLAPP Motion dismissed. It made allegations that pharma lobbying and a connection to Doug Ford were the reasons the Canada Christian College and School of Graduate Theological Studies didn’t receive Provincial certification. The school was against vaccine mandates. While Kory Teneycke is indeed a lobbyist with Rubicon Strategies, and has political ties to Ford, cause and effect couldn’t be established.\\n\\n[3] Dong v. Global News is another case that survived an anti-SLAPP Motion in Ontario. Some CSIS sources had believed that M.P. Han Dong had betrayed the “2 Michaels” who were held by China. However, Global News published this as if it were an established fact. The defences of truth and responsible communication failed.\\n\\nA4C may face the same hurdles with establishing truth or responsible publication. All 3 of the above cases saw their Motions dismissed, at substantial costs to the Defendants.\\n\\nAnother problem here is that not everything can be classified as expression.\\n\\n18. On or about January 20, 2023, the Defendants, Action4Canada and/or Person A, created an online petition entitled “STOP Taxpayer Funded Drag Queen Sexualization of Children” (the “Petition”), and posted the Petition on the website CitizenGo. The Petition remains available online for individuals to sign virtually.\\n\\n19. Please sign and share this petition and demand that the City of Kelowna STOP using taxpayers’ money to fund Drag Queen Story Hours, and further demand that the School District reassess Mr. Cook’s suitability as an EA”.\\n\\nOne other factor that goes against A4C relying on anti-SLAPP laws is that this wasn’t just about expression or speech. They created a petition, and essentially tried to get him fired from his job.\\n\\nWould This Lawsuit Be Covered By Insurance?\\n\\n44. On or about April 25, June 18, and December 4, 2024, counsel for the Plaintiff sent cease and desist letters to the Defendants, advising them that the Defamatory Publications were false and defamatory. The cease and desist letters demanded that the Defendants remove the Defamatory Publications from the internet and refrain from posting further defamatory statements.\\n\\nAccording to the NOCC, Cook’s lawyers sent several cease and desist letters demanding that the content in question be removed. A4C does have insurance, which is not surprising. However, it would be interesting to know if these letters were ever forwarded. For the purpose of mitigating risk, they should have been.\\n\\n(a) If these letters were never forwarded, an insurance company may very well refuse to cover a lawsuit, and leave A4C to fend for themselves.\\n\\n(b) If these letters were indeed forwarded, it’s inevitable that an insurer would have insisted the content be removed. After all, their business involves minimizing risk. If that was ignored, then again, the insurer would likely refuse to cover the expenses involved in defending the case.\\n\\nSo, A4C is in trouble again. If the group had any sense, they would take down the postings — voluntarily — and work to settle the case quickly. It’s not disputed at all that Cook does drag shows, but the other allegations may be very difficult to prove.\\n\\nAction4Canada needs to hire a competent lawyer.\\n\\n(1) Cook Action4Canada – Notice

SecreSocial Welfare Department of the Presidency in charge of the shelter, in a statement indicated, without specifying a number, that there were children who “abandoned the facilities” when the break-in occurred and are now wanted.\\n\\n“With this, they evaded the temporary and exceptional shelter process with which they were being beneficiaries,” said that secretariat, adding that an “alert” was activated used in the search for missing minors.\\n\\nGuatemalan authorities rescued the 160 children on a sect farm on Friday Lev Tahorwhich was investigated for alleged sexual abuse of minors.\\n\\nThe sect’s property, which was raided, is located in the municipality of Oratorioabout 60 km southwest of the capital.\\n\\nAccording to the Prosecutor’s Office, the raid during which the children were rescued was carried out due to “suspicion” of human trafficking crimes “in the form of forced pregnancy, abuse of minors and rape.”\\n\\nDuring the raid, the alleged remains of a minor were found, according to the prosecutor’s office.\\n\\nGoldman called the allegations against the ultra-Orthodox Jewish sect “lies.”\\n\\n“The authorities carried out a very large investigation here in Guatemala, with reports, they tell lies with false complaints,” Goldman said.\\n\\nJewish sect in Guatemala was in the crosshairs of the authorities\\n\\nThe Lev Tahor sect was targeted by authorities over allegations of child abuse, forced marriages and teenage pregnancies.\\n\\nYou might be interested: Panama rejects Trump’s threat to regain control of the Canal\\n\\nThe sect, which

outside (to) destroy the community, we ask for support from the world,” said the family representative.\\n\\nLev Tahor was formed in the years 1980 and its members, who wear dark robes and practice an

The Canadian Press/Jonathan Hayward\\n\\nReports of online child exploitation have surged by 45 percent in just one year, Public Safety Canada said, urging parents to engage in conversations with their children.\\n\\n“Open conversations with your kids can close opportunities for predators,” the department said in a Dec. 23 post on the social media platform X, where it shared the figure.\\n\\nThe statistic on the rise in online child exploitation was shared by Cybertip.ca , Canada’s national tipline for reporting the sexual exploitation of children, operated by the Canadian Centre for Child Protection (CCCP). In 2023, Cybertip.ca reported processing a total of 27,429 reports.\\n\\nOntario led the case numbers with 6,710 reports, followed by British Columbia with 2,003, and Quebec with 1,557. The tipline also received 8,609 reports from international sources.\\n\\nThe majority of reported incidents, 21,164 cases, involved individuals possessing, manufacturing, distributing, or accessing child sexual abuse material, including child pornography. Additionally, 2,797 reports concerned “online harms to children,” while 2,785 involved “luring a child.”\\n\\nOnline child sexual exploitation is defined as when children are manipulated into viewing or participating in sexual online encounters, according to Public Safety Canada.\\n\\nThe department highlighted several key dangers of online child sexual exploitation, including grooming , where an adult builds trust with a child to manipulate and control the child by normalizing inappropriate behaviours. Cybertip.ca also warned that child grooming can occur offline, noting that 500 students were sexually victimized, or allegedly victimized, by school personnel between 2017 and 2021, involving about 252 current or former employees in Canadian K-12 schools.\\n\\nAnother concern is “ sexting ,” where children share sexual messages, images, or videos online. Public Safety Canada warned that while older kids may see it as harmless, once shared, these materials are out of the child’s control and can cause lasting harm. A more dangerous form, sextortion, involves blackmail, where a person threatens to distribute sexual content of the child unless they provide more, pay money, or comply with other demands.\\n\\nAdditionally, “ capping” involves adults recording or taking screenshots of youths engaged in sexual activities on video platforms or apps, often without the victims’ knowledge.

a sweeping investigation into cases of teenage pregnancy following the arrest of a 28-year-old man accused of impregnating a 13-year-old girl. The teenager gave birth on Christmas Day at Seshego Hospital, one of 31 teenage mothers to deliver babies in Limpopo on the same day. This incident has reignited national debate about child exploitation, statutory rape, and systemic failures in protecting minors.\\n\\nProvincial Police Commissioner Lieutenant-General Thembi Hadebe has vowed to investigate every case of teenage pregnancy in the province, issuing a stern warning to those who prey on underage girls. “We are picking up on this trend, particularly during festive periods like Christmas and New Year, where young girls are found pregnant, and the perpetrators are adults. This must stop,” Hadebe said.\\n\\nDetails of the Arrest and Investigation\\n\\nThe 28-year-old man, who worked as a waiter at a Polokwane restaurant, was arrested on Boxing Day by the Family Violence, Child Protection, and Sexual Offences Unit (FCS). According to police, the suspect began a relationship with the 13-year-old earlier in the year, after meeting her at a shopping centre under the pretext of offering to help her with mathematics.\\n\\nPolice spokesperson Malesela Ledwaba confirmed that the relationship turned intimate in May. The victim disclosed her condition to her aunt in November after experiencing severe abdominal pain. Medical tests revealed she was eight months pregnant. “This arrest demonstrates our commitment to ensuring that justice is served, and we will leave no stone unturned in protecting vulnerable children,” Ledwaba said.\\n\\nFamily Reacts to Arrest\\n\\nThe family of the young girl has expressed both relief at the arrest and anguish over the situation. The girl’s 35-year-old aunt, who is helping care for the child, described the ordeal as devastating. “My heart is in pain. He should have seen a child when he looked at her. We trusted that she was too young for such things,” the aunt said.\\n\\nThe family faces significant financial strain as the girl, too young to breastfeed, requires formula and other baby necessities. The aunt revealed that the girl’s single mother works on a farm, leaving the teenager in the care of her grandmother and siblings. “I wish he could be made responsible for all the expenses,” the aunt added.\\n\\nGovernment and Civil Society Response\\n\\nLimpopo Premier Dr Phophi Ramathuba has condemned the incident, praising police for their swift response. “It is now our responsibility to ensure that the judiciary acts in accordance with the severity of the crime,” Ramathuba said. She has dispatched MECs from the Departments of Health, Social Development, and Community Safety to ensure the young mother receives adequate support.\\n\\nThe case has also drawn attention from civil society organisations like the SGB Federation, which has called for urgent action to address teenage pregnancy. “These are not ‘teen moms’; these are children whose innocence has been stolen. Their pregnancies are not a result of consent but of gross violations of their rights,” said Federation spokesperson Derick Mosoana.\\n\\nBroader Teenage Pregnancy Crisis in Limpopo\\n\\nThe Christmas Day births underscore a broader problem in the province. According to the Department of Health, 31 teenage mothers gave birth in Limpopo on Christmas Day, part of a larger national tally of 90 teenage births. While interventions like Sexual Reproductive Health campaigns and Youth-Friendly Zones at clinics have contributed to a slight decline in teenage pregnancies, the numbers remain alarmingly high.\\n\\nCommissioner Hadebe highlighted the systemic challenges contributing to the crisis. “We find that many of these cases involve girls from vulnerable backgrounds, whose parents are often unaware of their pregnancies until it’s too late. This makes them easy targets for predators,” she said.\\n\\nHadebe has directed police to collaborate with the Department of Health to monitor teenage pregnancies and investigate each case where statutory rape may have occurred. “Every perpetrator will be held accountable,” she promised.\\n\\nCourt Proceedings\\n\\nThe suspect is expected to appear in court soon to face charges of statutory rape. Legal experts have emphasised the importance of ensuring that cases involving minors are handled with sensitivity and urgency. “The judiciary must send a clear message that such crimes will not be tolerated,” said Thilivhali Muavha, spokesperson for the Premier.\\n\\nCalls for Systemic Change\\n\\nAdvocacy groups and government officials agree that addressing teenage pregnancy requires a multifaceted approach. In addition to law enforcement, experts are calling for enhanced education and community awareness. “Parents need to engage in open conversations with their children about sex and consent, even if they think they’re too young. Ignorance creates opportunities for predators,” said Mosoana.\\n\\nThe SGB Federation has also urged stricter penalties for offenders and more robust support systems for young mothers. “Our focus must be on preventing these atrocities by addressing the root causes, including poverty, lack of education, and inadequate social services,” Mosoana said.\\n\\nRoad Ahead\\n\\nAs the 28-year-old awaits his court appearance, the case has become a rallying point for greater action against child exploitation. Limpopo police have pledged to use this incident as a springboard for broader investigations, while government leaders stress the importance of collective responsibility in protecting South Africa’s children.\\n\\nPremier Ramathuba’s spokesperson summed up the sentiment: “This case is a reminder that we cannot remain silent while our children suffer. It’s time for all sectors of society to come together to fight this scourge.”\\n\\nPolice and Public Awareness Campaigns\\n\\nIn response to the alarming statistics, police in Limpopo have launched public awareness campaigns aimed at educating communities about the signs of child exploitation and the importance of reporting suspicious behaviour. Hadebe urged parents and guardians to be vigilant, particularly during festive seasons, when such incidents tend to spike.\\n\\n“We want to ensure that no child becomes a victim of such heinous acts. Community involvement is key to stopping this trend,” Hadebe said.\\n\\n28-Year-Old Arrested After 13-Year-Old Gives Birth on Christmas Day in Limpopo\\n\\n🔴Central News Weekly Edition 087🔴 Download

online child exploitation have surged by 45 percent in just one year, Public Safety Canada said, urging parents to engage in conversations with their children.\\n\\n“Open conversations with your kids can close opportunities for predators,” the department said in a Dec. 23 post on the social media platform X, where it shared the figure.\\n\\nThe statistic on the rise in online child exploitation was shared by Cybertip.ca, Canada’s national tipline for reporting the sexual exploitation of children, operated by the Canadian Centre for Child Protection (CCCP). In 2023, Cybertip.ca reported processing a total of 27,429 reports.\\n\\nOntario led the case numbers with 6,710 reports, followed by British Columbia with 2,003, and Quebec with 1,557. The tipline also received 8,609 reports from international sources.\\n\\nThe majority of reported incidents, 21,164 cases, involved individuals possessing, manufacturing, distributing, or accessing child sexual abuse material, including child pornography. Additionally, 2,797 reports concerned “online harms to children,” while 2,785 involved “luring a child.”\\n\\nOnline child sexual exploitation is defined as when children are manipulated into viewing or participating in sexual online encounters, according to Public Safety Canada.\\n\\nRelated Stories\\n\\nThe department highlighted several key dangers of online child sexual exploitation, including grooming, where an adult builds trust with a child to manipulate and control the child by normalizing inappropriate behaviours. Cybertip.ca also warned that child grooming can occur offline, noting that 500 students were sexually victimized, or allegedly victimized, by school personnel between 2017 and 2021, involving about 252 current or former employees in Canadian K-12 schools.\\n\\nAnother concern is “sexting,” where children share sexual messages, images, or videos online. Public Safety Canada warned that while older kids may see it as harmless, once shared, these materials are out of the child’s control and can cause lasting harm. A more dangerous form, sextortion, involves blackmail, where a person threatens to distribute sexual content of the child unless they provide more, pay money, or comply with other demands.\\n\\nAdditionally, “capping” involves adults recording or taking screenshots of youths engaged in sexual activities on video platforms or apps, often without the victims’ knowledge.

“dungeon-like” basement room, both admitted in court to abusing the children.\\n\\nCharles Edmonson, 64, pleaded guilty Friday in Clermont County Common Pleas Court to kidnapping, felonious assault and three counts of child endangering. His wife, 50-year-old Matthew Edmonson, pleaded guilty to five counts of child endangering.\\n\\nAs part of their plea agreements, prosecutors moved to dismiss another 48 counts against Charles Edmonson, as well as 44 other counts Matthew Edmonson faced. They also removed the possibility of Charles Edmonson receiving a life sentence.\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMore: Adopted boys will need 'lifetime' of care after years of abuse. Were there red flags?\\n\\nJudge Richard Ferenc imposed a minimum prison term of 15 years for Charles Edmonson and 13 years for his wife, although the Edmonsons could spend more time behind bars under a law that says the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections can extend someone's sentence based on their conduct in prison.\\n\\nCharles Edmonson, 64, appeared in Clermont County Common Pleas Court for sentencing on Friday.\\n\\n“This was very carefully considered, negotiated, discussed over the last few months with the prosecuting attorney on this case,” said Alex Deardorff, Charles Edmonson’s attorney. “We’re very appreciative of them offering him this firm sentence.”\\n\\nCharles Edmonson declined to speak during his sentencing. The Clermont County Prosecutor’s Office previously said the couple faced possible sentences of more than 200 years.\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nTheir biological son, Bailey Edmonson, was also sentenced on Friday to two years of probation after pleading guilty to three misdemeanor counts of child endangering.\\n\\nMatthew Edmonson, 50, appears in Clermont County Common Pleas Court for sentencing on Friday.\\n\\n\"I know it's taken a lot of mistakes to be here, and I'm now seeing the bigger picture,\" Matthew Edmonson said through tears. \"I want to break the negative cycle. I'm asking for forgiveness. I want my sons to receive psychological and emotional healing.\"\\n\\nAbuse of adopted boys lasted over 5-year period\\n\\nProsecutors said the boys, four of whom have a genetic condition associated with intellectual and developmental problems, were under constant video surveillance throughout the house. Court records indicate the abuse started when the youngest boys were about 3 years old and continued for more than five years.\\n\\nThe brothers were adopted by the Edmonsons in February 2019, more than a year after their birth parents’ rights were terminated in Richland County, Ohio. However, court records state the abuse began as early as July 2018, around when the Edmonsons fostered the boys.\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nFive years after their adoption, the boys, then 13, 11 and 8-year-old triplets, were removed from the Edmonsons’ home by court order in February. Because of the abuse they experienced, they each “will require years if not a lifetime of psychiatric treatment,” prosecutors said in court filings.\\n\\nConcerns about boys' welfare began as early as 2023\\n\\nWhile the Edmonsons weren’t formally accused of child abuse until June, court records show that Clermont County Children’s Protective Services became worried about the kids’ safety in early 2023.\\n\\nThe agency started working on a voluntary case plan with the Edmonsons in January of that year “due to concerns about the family's ability to protect the children and meet their extraordinary needs,” court records state.\\n\\nBefore criminal charges were filed, a juvenile court magistrate noted the children faced numerous risks at home, including physical abuse by their older sibling and denial of drinking water.\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe magistrate also found Matthew Edmonson would make the boys clean themselves with cold water, even though hot water was readily available, as punishment for bathroom accidents. Prosecutors said this resulted in the children developing a fear of cold water.\\n\\nProsecutors: Boys monitored on cameras, held in basement room\\n\\nAmong the various forms of “punishment” prosecutors outlined in an August court filing, they said the boys were placed in a basement room that had nothing but a steel-framed bunk bed, which often lacked a mattress or blanket.\\n\\nProsecutors said the boys were deprived of clothes, food and water while in the room – a punishment that at times lasted all night requiring the children to sleep naked on the bare floor.\\n\\nThe boys were initially locked inside the room, however, the Edmonsons later installed an alarm that triggered whenever the door opened, prosecutors said, adding cameras monitored the children throughout the house.\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nProsecutors said that still photos from those cameras showed one of the children tied to a bed in the basement. The evidence pointed to Charles Edmonson as being the one to tie the child down, as his wife had been suffering from carpal tunnel and underwent surgery around that time.\\n\\nThe boys also had restricted access to water, and food was often withheld as a punishment, prosecutors said. They added the children were sometimes sent to school without food and routinely complained of being hungry. One was even found scavenging food out of the trash.\\n\\nProsecutors said one child even reported to school officials that urine and feces were rubbed into his eyes as a punishment.\\n\\nPolice records indicate the boys attended Milford Exempted Village Schools after being removed from the Batavia Local School District. Prosecutors said the children were told not to speak with child protective services, police or school nurses, as “those entities were bad.\"\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nThe abuse was only uncovered as part of a separate sexual abuse investigation into Charles Edmonson, who pleaded guilty in March to gross sexual imposition counts and was sentenced to three years in prison for sexually assaulting his adopted, adult son.\\n\\nThis article originally appeared on Cincinnati Enquirer: Batavia couple sentenced for subjecting adopted boys to years of abuse"}, "meta": {}, "created_at":

The hotline is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\\n\\nThree days before Christmas.\\n\\nAt least that's when police were called.\\n\\nIn a bedroom inside a home on the city's west side, all 7-year-old Kayden Gavarrete had was a small couch, a dog cage, and a futon bed frame with a Bluey sleeping bag and pillow. His frail body was found in that room on Dec. 22 by Indianapolis Metropolitan Police, who were called to the South Pershing Avenue home by the boy's father.\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIt's unclear how long he was dead, but the coroner noted rigor mortis was setting in. Kayden was found burned, bruised and malnourished.\\n\\nThe boy's father, Kevin Gavarrete, and his on-again, off-again girlfriend, Julia Sizemore, are facing preliminary charges of neglect resulting in death. The couple have dated for three years and have two daughters under 2 years old. At the time of Kayden's death, they weren't together, but Sizemore sometimes stayed at the home with Kayden.\\n\\nA probable cause affidavit filed in the case gives horrifying details into Kayden's final weeks alive and his death has enraged those who felt denied access to make sure the boy was OK.\\n\\n\"(Kevin) kept him away from his mother's side of the family, unfortunately,\" said Jessica Ryan, one of Kayden's great aunts on his mother's side. The boy's mother, Tamara Mason, died in May 2022.\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nFor many of Mason's relatives, her death marked the last time they would see Kayden alive.\\n\\nPhoto of Kayden Gavarette\\n\\nKayden adored and missed his mother, Ryan said. In the hours before his death, Kayden told Sizemore that “he was going to see his mom,” she later recounted to investigators.\\n\\n\"They were very close,\" Ryan said. \"She was a very good mother to Kayden.\"\\n\\nRyan said her family did not learn about the abuse Kayden was facing until it was too late. The boy was homeschooled and had been since the beginning of the school year, his father told police.\\n\\nKayden: 2 arrested after 7-year-old boy found dead in Indianapolis home\\n\\nMultiple bruises, lacerations and scabs\\n\\nAt 3:42 p.m. Dec. 22, police were called to the 1300 block of South Pershing Avenue. According to court records, they knocked on the door of a home and waited 1-2 minutes for a response.\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nGavarrete answered and said he needed help fast.\\n\\nIn the bedroom, Kayden was lying face-up on the floor. Within minutes medics had pronounced the boy dead at the scene and noticed abrasions and darkening on his face. The father told police Kayden didn't have any medical issues and the last time he saw the boy alive was around 9 or 10 p.m. the night before. According to court records, 30-45 minutes before calling police, Gavarrete knocked on his son's door and found him unresponsive.\\n\\nLater on, while police were at the scene, Gavarrete's sister arrived at the home.\\n\\nShe told them Gavarrete cut contact with her years ago and she hadn't seen Kayden in that time. She's never met Sizemore but sent her messages trying to get her to explain what happened. She denied knowing anything about how the boy died.\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nDetectives immediately noticed Kayden had multiple bruises, lacerations, scabs and what appeared to be small burn marks on his face and body. He also appeared to be extremely malnourished and severely underweight.\\n\\nAccording to court records, the Marion County Coroner's Office conducted an external exam of Kayden, noting he had rigor mortis in his jaw and head, but not anywhere else on his body. The examiner also pointed out to detectives bruising on the boy's stomach, legs and feet. He had multiple scratches, cuts and abrasions across his body varying in different lengths and depths.\\n\\n'Some whoopings' as a form of discipline\\n\\nPhoto of Kayden Gavarette\\n\\nWhile being interviewed by detectives, Gavarrete said he just started a new job and worked an overnight 12-hour shift. He and Kayden were the only ones who lived in the home and Sizemore occasionally stayed with them.\\n\\nThe last time Kayden went to see a doctor was more than a year ago, according to the father. He thought Kayden weighed about 50 pounds at that doctor's visit but told police in the days before his death the boy weighed about 30 pounds.\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nRelated: Kids could be sleeping in your local DCS office. Here's how often it happens in Indiana.\\n\\nKayden had been sick for about a month, the father told police, not wanting to eat or drink anything. He had to force-feed the boy. About three weeks ago, Kayden was acting out and Gavarrete believed he had been drinking chemicals because the bottles were becoming empty, but he never saw Kayden ingesting them. The types of chemicals were not specified in the arrest affidavit.\\n\\nWhen shown photos of Kayden's body at the scene, Gavarrete said Kayden had caused the marks and bruises during the past couple of weeks while throwing tantrums and falling to the ground. He planned to take Kayden to a hospital to get him evaluated but was afraid of what the medical staff would think.\\n\\nHe told police he would do \"some whoopings\" as a form of discipline, but when asked about the burn marks, he believed Kayden would sleep near heater vents in his room. The coroner later told investigators a heater could cause some of the injuries, but not all of them, police noted in their affidavit.\\n\\n'Acting weird around her girls'\\n\\nSizemore was brought in for questioning by police the same day.\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nSizemore told police she and her daughters moved out of the house because Kayden started \"acting weird around her girls,\" when they would spend time at Gavarrete's home. She had planned to get help for him because she believed the 7-year-old had a mental illness and or at least ADHD. After all, he couldn't seem to sit still.\\n\\n\"Kayden was a very hyper child, but he was happy and loving when he wanted to be,\" Sizemore said, according to court documents. She told police he didn't like taking showers, didn't eat any food and would only drink liquids.\\n\\nShe was the one who took Kayden to his last doctor's appointment about a year and a half ago and remembers him weighing 45 pounds.\\n\\nWhen shown photos of Kayden's body at the scene, Sizemore said she had told Gavarrete to take him to a hospital but the father refused. She also said she'd never seen him hit Kayden and that the boy would fall and throw temper tantrums injuring himself.\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nDetectives asked why she never took Kayden to a hospital and Sizemore said she \"voiced her concerns but did not want to get into (Gavarrete's) personal business.\"\\n\\nWhen asked if she would take her daughters to a hospital if they looked how Kayden did, she told police she would.\\n\\nBoy made to 'stand in a corner all day' as punishment\\n\\nOne family member who spoke with police told them Sizemore had called on Dec. 22 and said Kayden had been drinking chemicals the day before his death that left him unable to move his legs. He stayed in his room and Sizemore said Gavarrete felt Kayden was lying, the relative told police.\\n\\nAccording to Sizemore's account of how Kayden was found, she went to his room at about 2 p.m. Dec. 22 and found the boy bleeding from his nose and mouth and yelled for Gavarrete. The father felt Kayden was cold and laid on a heater to warm him up, the court records state.\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nGavarrete told Sizemore to take their daughters and leave the home in fear of DCS taking them away, which is when she fled to a hotel, according to the affidavit.\\n\\nA family member who lived with Gavarrete earlier this year told police he never saw the boy being struck — punishments usually meant the boy would \"stand in a corner all day\" — but he could tell Kayden was scared of his father and Sizemore.\\n\\nOften the family member would feed Kayden because the boy was \"always hungry,\" which angered the couple, according to the affidavit. The relative also bought the boy a bed but said he would still sleep on the floor.\\n\\nGavarrete and Sizemore remained booked into Marion County Jail and online court records did not show a scheduled first appearance as of Friday afternoon.\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nOver the past two years, relatives of the boy's mother tried to visit Kayden, but communication between Gavarrete and Mason's family dried up.\\n\\n\"Me and my sister were wanting to see him and she was trying to make contact with Kevin again,\" Ryan told IndyStar. \"We thought we were making progress.\"\\n\\nJade Jackson is a Public Safety Reporter for the Indianapolis Star.

January 1, which were initiated by his office. These laws focus on child protection, civil rights, workplace safety, and crime victim support.\\n\\n“My office has continued to work with the General Assembly to develop legislation to protect children, increase access to state services and advocate for the rights of workers and marginalized communities,” Raoul stated. He emphasized ongoing collaboration with law enforcement and legislators in crafting policies that safeguard Illinois residents.\\n\\nHouse Bill 4623 addresses the issue of child sexual abuse images created using Artificial Intelligence (AI). It prohibits AI-generated images that involve real children or obscene imagery. The bill was introduced by Raoul and sponsored by Sen. Mary Edly-Allen and Rep. Jennifer Gong-Gershowitz. The Attorney General’s office provided expert testimony on technological advances that enable realistic image creation, highlighting the harm these images cause.\\n\\nRaoul’s office also operates the Illinois Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force with support from a U.S. Department of Justice grant.\\n\\nHouse Bill 5371 aims to enhance civil rights protections under the Illinois Human Rights Act (IHRA). Sponsored by Sen. Laura Fine and Rep. Ann Williams, it clarifies terms like “per violation” for discriminatory practices and increases penalty amounts in pattern-and-practice determinations. It also codifies language from the Illinois Civil Rights Act of 2003 to prevent unjustified disparate impacts in real estate transactions.\\n\\nHouse Bill 5561 seeks to protect workers from employer retaliation, expanding protections under state law through the Illinois Whistleblower Act. Sponsored by Sen. Cristina Castro and Rep. Marcus Evans, it broadens conduct definitions protected under whistleblower laws and includes provisions against blacklisting and immigration-based retaliation.\\n\\nSenate Bill 3713 enhances access to the Illinois Crime Victims Compensation Program administered by Raoul’s office. Sponsored by Sen. Robert Peters and Rep. Maurice West II, it expands eligibility for victims of violent crime seeking reimbursement for expenses such as medical charges or relocation costs.\\n\\nThese legislative efforts reflect cooperative endeavors between Raoul’s office, various stakeholders including Ascend Justice, and advocacy groups like the Alliance for Safety and Justice."}, "meta": {}, "created_at":

"NEW YORK (AP) — An Alabama woman who says she was raped by Jay-Z and Sean “Diddy” Combs when she was 13 can proceed anonymously, for now, in her lawsuit against the rap moguls, a judge ruled Thursday. In her written order, Judge Analisa Torres also chastised the lawyer representing Jay-Z for what she described as his combative motions and “inflammatory language” against the plaintiff’s lawyer, calling them inappropriate. The Manhattan jurist said the woman can proceed anonymously at this early stage of the litigation, but she may be required to reveal her identity at a later date, if the case proceeds. That would allow defense lawyers to collect facts necessary to prepare for trial. Torres also cited “substantial interest” from the public. Combs remains jailed in New York awaiting a criminal trial on federal sex trafficking charges. He also faces a wave of sexual assault lawsuits, many of which were filed by the plaintiff’s lawyer, Tony Buzbee, a Texas attorney who says his firm represents over 150 people, both men and women, who allege sexual abuse and exploitation by Combs."}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.712378Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-10T19:19:12.218824Z", "inner_id": 60, "total_annotations": 2,

Many sex crimes in Texas also carry the potential for sex offender registration, which can lead to a defendant’s name and personal information being placed on a public website, restrictions on where a person can live or travel, and even limitations on what kind of employment a person can accept. But what exactly does sex offender registration require? What offenses require sex offender registration and how long is the registration period?\\n\\nThe information provided below is for educational purposes only and is not legal advice. Failure to comply with sex offender requirements is a serious felony and you should always speak to an experienced sex crimes attorney to understand the sex offender requirements and restrictions relating to your particular charge. The requirements for sex offender registration are complex and may vary depending on the criminal history of the defendant and the sex offender registration requirements that were in effect at the time of the alleged offense.\\n\\nHow Does Sex Offender Registration Work in Texas?\\n\\nIn Texas, anyone with what is known as a “reportable conviction” for a listed sex offense is required to register as a sex offender. Reportable convictions include any type of conviction, probation or deferred adjudication probation for a designated sex offense. Depending on the specific offense, sex offender registration lasts for either 10-years or lifetime. The registration period begins after the term of probation or prison is complete, although a person on probation will be required to register while on probation under Texas Code of Criminal Procedure 42.12(e).\\n\\nMost of the requirements for sex offender registration are contained in Chapter 62 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure. Among other requirements, sex offender registration requires the offender to register with the local law enforcement authority in any city or county where the person resides or intends to reside for more than seven days.\\n\\nRegistration requires a sex offender to provide extensive personal information to law enforcement, including address, vehicle information, physical details and a color photograph. Most information relating to a sex offender is considered public information except for sensitive items like social security numbers or driver’s license numbers. This information is publicly available and searchable through the Texas Department of Public Safety’s website or local websites, such as the city of Houston’s “Offender Watch” website. A sex offender must re-register and verify this information every year (this period can be shorter for sexually violent predators or those with two or more convictions).\\n\\nOther restrictions for sex offenders include:\\n\\nProhibitions on living on campus\\n\\nProhibitions on certain jobs for sexually violent offenders\\n\\nRestrictions on entering schools\\n\\nThe Department of Public Safety also maintains a useful website with answers to many frequently asked questions regarding sex offender registration.\\n\\nIn addition to the requirements of sex offender registration, a person who registers as a sex offender must also comply with local ordinances applicable to registered sex offenders. In Texas, cities and municipalities have the right to restrict sex offenders from going near child safety zones. For example, the cities of Pasadena and Baytown both have laws that prohibit registered sex offenders from going within 1000 and 1500 feet of child safety zones, respectively. These requirements can vary by city and a sex offender must familiarize himself with the specific requirements before travelling to a new city.

CA]\\n\\n\\n\\nDecember 13, 2024\\n\\nBy Candice Nguyen, Michael Bott, and Robbie Beasom\\n\\nIn front of a packed courtroom, with Oakland Bishop Michael Barber looking on, eight survivors who East Bay priests sexually abused as children or teens recounted traumatic stories in front of U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge William Lafferty on Friday as part of the diocese’s ongoing bankruptcy case.\\n\\nMany of the survivors were overcome with emotion as they recalled being forced into sex acts or raped by trusted priests when they were as young as five-years-old. Some of the accused perpetrators are notorious priests with long track records of abuse allegations, like Stephen Kiesle or Don Broderson. In other cases, the alleged abuser had never been publicly accused before this recent wave of lawsuits, like the now-deceased Monsignor John McCracken.\\n\\n“It meant a lot to be able to come and talk and have the judge listen,” said survivor Sherry Waterworth, who said she was abused by Stephen Kiesle when she was seven. “I know it does no good in the case, but hopefully in my journey to heal.”\\n\\nWaterworth, who recounted past struggles with drug abuse, said she later came to find out her sister had also been abused by Kiesle.\\n\\n“I’ve lost faith in churches, I’ve lost faith in the justice system,” Waterworth said. “But I’m hoping to get it back.”\\n\\nFor two hours, Judge Lafferty listened on, sometimes looking visibly pained by the stories he heard.\\n\\n“We’re here today because of some very, very, very difficult circumstances,” said Lafferty, acknowledging the unique situation of addressing hundreds of child sexual abuse claims in a court traditionaly geared towards resolving economic issues. “It was my decision that it was important to do it, and it was important to do it now, not the end of the case when everything is done and dusted.”\\n\\nFrom drug and alcohol abuse, to attempts at suicide, the survivors detailed how the scars of abuse have marked them for life. Some said they shared stories that they’ve kept hidden from their partners or closest family members, such as one victim who said she never had children because she couldn’t bear the touch of a male doctor after years of abuse at the hands of a priest.\\n\\n“I will always mourn the children I could have had,” said the survivor, adding that she’s currently battling breast cancer that caught in its late stages because of her avoidance of doctors.\\n\\nThe speakers are among roughly 400 people who have sued the Diocese of Oakland since 2020 after a state law opened a three-year window for child sexual abuse survivors to file claims in civil court no matter how far back their allegations go. The flood of claims have driven Catholic dioceses across California, including the Diocese of Oakland, into bankruptcy.\\n\\nSome of those who spoke questioned whether the church truly couldn’t settle the claims without filing for bankruptcy protection, and accused Barber of putting the diocese’s bank account before victims.\\n\\n“Since this bankruptcy process began, I’ve been having nightmares,” one survivor of John McCracken said. “It feels as though the Diocese is more concerned with protecting its assets.”\\n\\nIn closing, the survivor asked Barber “What would Jesus do” in a situation like this?\\n\\nOne speaker, clearly the youngest among the eight survivors, said he chose to speak up to show that “child sexual abuse in the Roman Catholic Church still exists.” He’s a victim of Fr. Hector David Mendoza-Vela, who was recently released from prison after pleading no contest to multiple counts of child molestation in 2019.\\n\\n“I am proof that the house is still burning,” he said. “[The church] could save the defenseless, they could put out the flames, but clearly they don’t.”\\n\\nFollowing two hours of testimony from survivors, Bishop Barber read a prepared statement apologizing to survivors, and saying he could see the “pain and destruction” wrought by abusers within the church.\\n\\n“I want to convey a sincere, complete, and unconditional apology,” Barber said. “I am truly sorry.”\\n\\nSome victims and members of the audience left the courtroom as he was about to speak.\\n\\n“I really didn’t want to hear anything he had to say because it was just words,” said survivor Catherine Hernandez.\\n\\nHowever, she said the opportunity to share her story felt like “a little peace, and weight off my shoulders and my soul.”\\n\\nNBC Bay Area attempted to speak with Barber as he left court, but he declined to be interviewed.\\n\\nLast month, the Diocese of Oakland filed a reorganization plan to emerge from bankruptcy that included a proposed payout of more than $100 million to settle more than 300 recent claims.\\n\\nAdvocates from the Survivors Network of those Abuse by Priests (SNAP), called the proposal “pathetic,” and plaintiff’s attorney Rick Simons said if it’s officially put in front of the creditor’s committee, he expects it to be overwhelmingly rejected.\\n\\nJudge Lafferty is expected to address the Diocese’s proposal at a hearing next week.\\n\\nYou can catch up on NBC Bay Area’s coverage of the new wave of sex abuse accusations hitting the Catholic Church by clicking

back tears as he recounted being molested about four decades ago, when he was just 5 or 6 years old, by Father George J. Francis of St. Bede Catholic Church in Hayward.\\n\\n“He would tell the best stories, and I would sit in his lap while he was wearing just a robe,” the man said.\\n\\nOne day, while Father Francis was reading him a story at the priest’s home, they suddenly started what he thought was playful wrestling, and the priest held him down, Speaker 7 said.\\n\\n“There was a pain in my bottom. I didn’t understand why he was hurting me. I didn’t understand I was being molested,” he said.\\n\\nOver two hours at federal bankruptcy court in Oakland last Friday, eight male and female survivors of alleged childhood sexual abuse at the hands of priests in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Oakland delivered emotional statements on how their lives had been forever changed by their abusers.\\n\\nThe statements are part of ongoing bankruptcy proceedings for the diocese, which filed for bankruptcy protection in May 2023 following a state law extending the statute of limitations on child sexual abuse lawsuits filed in California. That change precipitated a wave of over 300 lawsuits against the Oakland Diocese.\\n\\nAttorneys for the survivors said this was a rare moment in bankruptcy court, which typically only deals in assets and funds, as it allowed survivors to give statements without being cross-examined or having the information used against them.\\n\\n“This is an opportunity for survivors to tell their truth and to share their lived experiences so that the court and the parties in the case are aware of the facts that underlie the bankruptcy and the reason there are so many claimants who have come forward,” said Jennifer Stein, an attorney with Jeff Anderson and Associates, which represents over 100 Diocese of Oakland abuse survivors.\\n\\nThe statements, made to U.S. Bankruptcy Judge William J. Lafferty III, detailed abuse that allegedly happened over multiple decades, from roughly the 1960s to the 1990s, in Catholic churches and schools across the East Bay, from Union City to Concord to Pinole.\\n\\nA number of the priests named in Friday’s statements have been faced with multiple sexual assault allegations, and at least one — Father Stephen M. Kiesle — is a registered sex offender, convicted of multiple sexual abuse crimes involving minors. Two others have previously been sued, and one settled. Two are dead.\\n\\nNone of the accused have yet been found liable in the civil lawsuits related to the bankruptcy proceedings.\\n\\nSurvivors spoke about the power church leaders had over the children in their charge and their exclusive access to them.\\n\\nSpeaker 2 said that as a child, Monsignor John T. McCracken, on several occasions, locked him in the library of St. Mary’s Church in Walnut Creek and molested him.\\n\\n“He gave me something to drink, pulled my pants down, and I felt a stabbing pain from behind,” he said. “He told me, ‘You’ll go to hell if you tell anyone.’”\\n\\nNearly all the speakers on Friday said they were raised by devout Catholic families who worked hard and saved money to send their children to Catholic schools, partly because they thought they would be safer there. And they all described the ongoing harm they suffer because of the abuse.\\n\\n“I chose not to have children, even though my husband wanted one,” Speaker 3 said. “I couldn’t be touched by men. I will always mourn the children I could have had.”\\n\\nShe went on to say that she is currently battling breast cancer, which she said was not detected early because she had avoided having hands-on medical checkups as a result of the abuse.\\n\\nOthers detailed ongoing problems with substance use, broken marriages, intimacy, weight and self-confidence linked to the abuse.\\n\\n“I started using and selling hard drugs in 8th grade,” Speaker 7 said, “I was hypersexualized. I’ve had nightmares my entire life.”\\n\\nIn November, the diocese proposed paying 345 abuse claimants between $464,492 and $574,637, with a total payment between $160.25 million and $198.25 million. That $38 million variance hinges on the diocese’s sale of property in Livermore.\\n\\nHowever, the committee representing the survivors filed an objection to the payment plan, calling it “inadequate.\\n\\n“ The Diocese of Oakland needs to look honestly at its financials and its ability to pay and to compensate people that they hurt,” said Stein, the attorney representing some of the survivors. “That amount needs to show that they understand that they made mistakes and want to take ownership and accountability for what happened, not just pay them enough to go away while they continue on with business as usual.”\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Judge Lafferty heard objections from the survivors’ committee but ultimately allowed the diocese’s repayment plan to move forward.\\n\\nHowever, he also required the diocese to make revisions to its proposed payment plan based on further scrutiny of its financial disclosures — including a roughly $106 million transfer of funds that it made about 30 days before declaring bankruptcy.\\n\\n“The court is going to allow the parties to be able to look into their different perspectives and for some of that information to be added to the disclosure statement so that it is better explained to the people who will be voting on the proposed plan,” Stein said.\\n\\nIn a statement last week, Oakland Bishop Michael C. Barber said: “We recognize that no amount of money can satisfactorily compensate survivors for the abuse they suffered. Bearing that in mind, we believe the plan compensates survivors in a fair and equitable way and allows the Diocese of Oakland to set a path forward to continue to spread the Gospel, serving the faithful and the poor.”\\n\\nIn court last Friday, many of the survivors directly appealed to Barber at the end of their statements.\\n\\n“It’s imperative that the diocese do the right thing and provide just compensation,” Speaker 2 said, facing Barber. “I ask you, ‘What would Jesus do?’”.\\n\\nAfter all eight survivors spoke, Barber asked to make a statement of his own, eliciting audible groans and prompting many of the survivors to walk out of the courtroom. Jennifer Stein, the attorney, said some survivors viewed it as “too little, too late.”\\n\\n“Insincere, opportunistic and inauthentic,” she said. “The words don’t match the actions.”\\n\\n“The sin of abuse is diametrically opposed to the will of God and must be utterly rejected by those who aspire to follow Christ and serve the members of his body,” Barber said. “For the suffering of each person who has been abused, I offer our deepest unconditional apology.”\\n\\nOutside court, Cathy Pickard, an abuse survivor who had spoken about her experience in a previous court appearance, said she has carried the trauma of her abuse throughout her life.\\n\\n“ You find ways to live your life, but you live a lie. Every minute of my life is a lie,” she said. “Until I was able to say what I said, that’s the only time that the truth of who I am comes out.”\\n\\nKQED’s Alex Hall contributed to this report\\n\\nhttps://www.kqed.org/news/12019043/youll-go-to-hell-if-you-tell-anyone-survivors-recount-childhood-sexual-abuse-at-oakland-diocese"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.712479Z", "updated_at": "2025-01-29T13:15:57.181285Z", "inner_id": 66, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60832, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 144951361, "annotations": [{"id": 53563956, "completed_by": {"id": 60832, "email": "iorwuesesolomon@gmail.com", "first_name": "Fanen", "last_name": "Iorwuese"}, "result": [{"id": "6X7Fmr0_4O", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Article"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}, {"id": "iXJxt2Yr2X", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Sexual Abuse"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "coercion_classifier"}, {"id": "gXJqY1ZtYK", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "recruitment_classifier"}, {"id": "KitPYAAInh", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Child Sexual Exploitation"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_classifier"}, {"id": "JzMZJ-0cG2", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Pornography"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_sub_classifier"}], "reviews": [], "history": [{"id": 58589015, "comment": null, "organization_id": 34950, "project_id": 122257, "annotation_id": 53563956, "draft_id": null, "review_id": null, "task_id": 144951361, "result": [{"id": "6X7Fmr0_4O", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Article"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}, {"id": "iXJxt2Yr2X", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Sexual Abuse"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "coercion_classifier"}, {"id": "gXJqY1ZtYK", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "recruitment_classifier"}, {"id": "KitPYAAInh", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Child Sexual Exploitation"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_classifier"}, {"id": "JzMZJ-0cG2", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Pornography"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_sub_classifier"}], "lead_time": 40.464, "action": "submitted", "started_at": "2025-01-29T13:15:56.907000Z", "created_at": "2025-01-29T13:16:39.643063Z", "created_by": 60832, "comment_id": null}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-01-29T13:16:39.469525Z", "updated_at": "2025-01-29T13:16:39.469542Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-01-29T13:16:22.091436Z", "lead_time": 40.464, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 5, "unique_id": "c4787643-4956-4a47-9dd7-ddc2c7a736f3", "import_id": null, "last_action": "submitted", "bulk_created": false, "task": 144951361, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60832, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": 60832}], "file_upload": "2d869759-batch_5_data.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "agreement": 100.0, "data": {"_id": {"$oid": "6770bbd76933901ae1d3cceb"}, "text": "Video from police cameras in Wall Township, New Jersey, shows officers chasing a former Target worker accused of secretly taking a photo up a customer’s skirt.\\n\\nThe suspect, David I.

The year 2024 saw lawmakers introduce tens of bills, some of which have drawn mixed feelings among Rwandans as well as raised debates among beneficiaries and officials.\\n\\nIn this article, The New Times compiles a list of some of the major legislations that were put in place.\\n\\nHealth services bill\\n\\nHealth services bill was tabled before parliament on November 5, which proposes among other things, to allow reproductive health services including contraception to teens aged from 15, and surrogacy regulations.\\n\\nTeenage contraception\\n\\nThis new bill proposes to allow access to reproductive health services, including contraception to teens aged from 15.\\n\\nThe bill is expected to reduce teenage pregnancies and their risks as the Minister of Health, Dr. Sabin Nsanzimana, said that 70 per cent of maternal and under five child deaths in Rwanda occur among teens who have not yet attained the age of majority [the current 18].\\n\\nHe added that research was carried out regarding the issue, indicating that in the last 12 months, health facilities in Rwanda received about 8,000 girls under 18 who were seeking pregnancy services.\\n\\nJacques Nsengiyumva, Executive Director of the Rwanda Women, Adolescent, and Child Health Initiative (RWACHI), highlighted the urgency of addressing teenage pregnancy, noting that “the current situation is alarming, as many young women are being impregnated.”\\n\\nOver the past five years, Rwanda has seen between 17,000 and 21,000 pregnancies annually among girls under 19, which he said is equivalent to “the population of a small sector like Gikomero [located in Gasabo District].”\\n\\nNsengiyumva emphasised that the issue places a heavy burden on young mothers who often struggle to care for their children.\\n\\nHe added that teenage pregnancies contribute significantly to malnutrition, with around 35 per cent of stunted children being born to teenage mothers.\\n\\nNsengiyumva, citing data from RWACHI, UNFPA, and RBC, explained that approximately 17 per cent of adolescents between the ages of 10 and 18 are sexually active.\\n\\nWhile laws have previously defined a child as anyone under 18, Nsengiyumva acknowledged that “many parents are unable to adequately care for their children” due to various challenges, including family conflicts.\\n\\nHe stressed the need for protection and education for those engaging in sexual activity, but added that “other teaching methods for avoiding sexual intercourse” should continue to be promoted.\\n\\nIn schools, comprehensive sexuality education is being implemented, and faith-based organizations are playing a role in helping students understand the importance of abstinence.\\n\\nNsengiyumva expressed hope that through these combined efforts, ‘50 per cent of teen pregnancies will be eliminated.’\\n\\nHowever, he cautioned that legal measures alone are not enough, saying “the law will not replace parent-child communication.”\\n\\nHe called on the Rwandan community to unite in the fight against child abuse and support adolescents in making informed decisions about their sexual health.\\n\\nAssisted reproductive technology services\\n\\nThe bill, introduced this year, contains provisions on assisted reproductive technologies, including surrogacy, to help couples with difficulty conceiving to have children.\\n\\nAccording to the Ministry of Health, there is an increase in the number of people who need assisted reproductive technology services – including surrogacy – that help couples who cannot conceive naturally, and that these services have started to be provided in Rwanda.\\n\\nAflodis Kagaba, Executive Director of the Health Development Initiative (HDI), told The New Times on December 25, that the newly proposed bill is expected to provide regulation for assisted reproductive technologies, including surrogacy.\\n\\nHe explained that the bill “will help people who are unable to conceive naturally, ensuring that the law facilitates these procedures properly and ethically.”\\n\\nKagaba also highlighted how the bill could benefit single women, noting that “a woman who has not found a partner but still wishes to have a child can use techniques like in vitro maturation (IVM).”\\n\\nHe emphasised that access to such reproductive technologies should be open to those who need it, but cautioned against commercializing surrogacy. “Anyone who needs to use it should be allowed, except in cases of commercial surrogacy, where women could be exploited and turned into tools for giving birth.”\\n\\nKagaba stressed the importance of providing adequate support to surrogates, including “basic necessities like proper nutrition and healthcare,” while avoiding the exploitation of surrogates through practices akin to expropriation.\\n\\nHe praised the development and implementation of scientific advancements in the field of reproductive health, adding that it is encouraging to see such progress as Rwanda continues to develop.\\n\\nA call for cosmetic surgery regulations\\n\\nDuring the tabling of the bill, Jean Claude Mazimpaka, a Member of Parliament, said that there is a need to regulate body modification done through cosmetic surgery in Rwanda.\\n\\nA branch of plastic surgery, cosmetic surgery is a procedure done to enhance, alter or reshape specific parts of the body, with the goal to change a person’s appearance.\\n\\nMP Mazimpaka highlighted the growing popularity of cosmetic surgery, especially among youth, and suggested including it in the medical services bill.\\n\\nMinister Nsanzimana acknowledged the global trend and agreed to discuss its regulation further at the parliamentary committee level, noting it was not a priority during the bill’s drafting.\\n\\nPension reforms\\n\\nRwanda Social Security Board (RSSB) stated on November 28, that starting January 2025, once the new pension reforms take effect, the pension contribution rate is expected to increase from the current 6 per cent of an employee’s basic salary to 12 per cent of their gross salary.\\n\\nTo facilitate a smooth transition to the 2030 target, the pensions body said the increase will be implemented incrementally in four years, with a two per cent annual increase from 2027 to reach 20 per cent in 2030.\\n\\nThe new family law\\n\\nA law gazetted July 30, allows 18-year-olds to marry on reasonable grounds, with the general legal age being 21. In addition, it recognizes unpaid care work in divorce cases and allows mutual separation without divorce.\\n\\nSome details of the law were drafted in the Health services bill for more regulations.\\n\\nNew mining law\\n\\nGazetted July 24, the new mining law introduced tougher penalties for illegal mining, with fines ranging from Rwf25 million to Rwf150 million and prison sentences of up to 10 years.\\n\\nThe penalties are significantly harsher than the previous 2018 law, which imposed fines of Rwf1 million to Rwf5 million and imprisonment of 2 to 6 months for illegal mineral activities.\\n\\nNew law governing banks\\n\\nThe new banking law gazetted June 10, strengthens Rwanda’s financial sector, positioning it as a global financial hub.\\n\\nIt aims to “provide a smooth environment for foreign investors,” and include regulations for branches of foreign banks, as well as allowing private banking to serve high-net-worth individuals.\\n\\nA draft law on simplified insolvency for micro and small enterprises\\n\\nThe government has tabled, before Parliament, a draft law on simplified insolvency for micro and small enterprises (MSEs), which is aimed at supporting investors faced with financial distress.\\n\\nThe new law, once enacted, could mean a difference for small businesses in Rwanda that often struggle with financial difficulties with limited options to recover from these difficulties.\\n\\nMoney laundering and terrorist financing bill\\n\\nApproved by the cabinet on November 9, proposed amendments to the money laundering and terrorist financing law aim to extend investigation periods and improve transparency on company ownership.\\n\\nThe changes address gaps in the current law and align Rwanda’s system with international standards.\\n\\nA law governing biosafety\\n\\nRwanda, on February 21, published in its Official Gazette a law governing biosafety, which seeks to ensure that genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are handled, transferred and used safely in the country.\\n\\nThe Coordinator of Roots and Tubers Program at Rwanda Agriculture and Animal Resources Development Board (RAB), Athanase Nduwumuremyi, told The New Times, “The existence of the law implies that there are means by which we can apply research and release research products to farmers.”\\n\\nSource: The New Times\\n\\nFor More News And Analysis About Rwanda

inappropriately touched his female patient during an exam, an Arkansas lawsuit said.\\n\\nThe patient is now suing him, saying Dr. David Diffine’s actions during exams throughout an 18-month doctor-patient relationship caused her anxiety, humiliation and other physical and emotional damage, the lawsuit filed on Dec. 17 said. The patient is also suing Diffine Family Practice where the doctor is employed.\\n\\nAttorney information for Diffine was not listed. The practice could not be reached for comment.\\n\\nBeginning in mid-2023, the woman sought medical care from the Diffine in Greene County, according to the lawsuit. During examinations, the doctor showed her his genitals, inappropriately touched\\n\\nSee STATE, page A3 STATE\\n\\nFrom page A2\\n\\nher and made lewd, sexual comments, the lawsuit said.\\n\\n“(Diffine’s) actions were intentional, deliberate, and served no legitimate medical purpose. Instead, they were designed to gratify his own sexual desires, abuse his position of trust, and humiliate (the patient),” according to the lawsuit.\\n\\nThis led to severe emotional and even physical impacts on the woman’s health. The lawsuit says she struggled to sleep and suffered other “physical manifestations of stress” as a result of the doctor’s actions. She now distrusts medical professionals, according to court documents.\\n\\nIn November, a 2019 video surfaced showing Diffine walking around the medical practice naked during business hours. The video also showed the man performing sex acts with a staff member in front of two other staff members in the receptionist’s area, the outlet reported.\\n\\nDiffine’s medical license was suspended by the Arkansas State Medical Board in October following reports of the physician engaging in sex acts with a staff member who was also a patient of his, according to the medical board.\\n\\nThe patient is seeking an undisclosed amount of damages to be determined by a jury, according to court documents.\\n\\nIf you have experienced sexual assault and need someone to talk to, call the National Sexual Assault Hotline for support at 1-800-656-4673 or visit the hotline's online chatroom.\\n\\n***\\n\\nMrs. Arkansas America,\\n\\nSearcy native, returns home to share anti-sex trafficking platform\\n\\nSEARCY — Arkansas ranks ninth in the United States in sex trafficking despite not being “even a border state,” according to Mrs. Arkansas America Brandy Huff Tarini, and she believes “it is important we address this” because “it’s here.”\\n\\nTarini, who lives in Little Rock, returned to her hometown of Searcy last week, making stops around town, including a tea at the historic Benjamin Clayton Black House, where she talked about her platform.\\n\\n“I have been a mentor for sex traffic survivors for over 10 years and I also mentor for troubled youth,” Tarini said.\\n\\n“I am a board member for PATH, which is Partners Against Trafficking Humans.\\n\\nI have been trained to be on the crisis response team, as well as the emergency help line.”\\n\\nShe said the mean age for sex trafficking is 12, but she also has seen 4-year-olds and even 18-month-olds who were trafficked. “You have to know who the enemy is, you have to know the playbook. We have to know who our opponent is.”\\n\\nSee STATE, page A9\\n\\nPhoto by Greg Geary STATE\\n\\nFrom page A3\\n\\n“… The interstate is really bad,” she said, mentioning an organization called Truckers Against Trafficking that has “done a huge deal in combating human trafficking.”\\n\\nTarini said those who are involved in sex traffickers are “master manipulators. The problem is that being a victim is glorified these days and so these kids, they want to be victims. And the next problem is getting these survivors to not be victims; that’s the big struggle. They don’t know how to not because they want attention, so they were getting attention when they were being trafficked. As a survivor, they don’t know how to get out of that.”\\n\\n“I think these kids are trying to escape bad situations and they are looking for something,” she said, advising parents to “just raise kids who are not vulnerable. Social media is huge. Don’t post stuff that is going to make you a target. Parents are doing a good job, but it’s mostly runaways and kids that are just in broken homes, kids of addicts.”\\n\\nTarini said there are two types of pimps preying on the children’s vulnerabilities.\\n\\n“There’s a ‘romeo pimp’ or a ‘guerilla pimp.’ … The romeo pimp will use manipulation in everything they can to reel you in and then the guerilla pimp will use violence to get you to stay. It’s a lot of manipulation. Sadly, a lot of these girls are getting some of their needs met and so that is what is keeping them. It’s sort of like Stockholm Syndrome, that’s what’s keeping them staying.”\\n\\nAccording to Tarini, only 1 percent of the victims are rescued nationally. She said when she was asked to participate in the Mrs. Arkansas America Pageant, which was held in June in Hot Springs, “I just decided if I can help just one person by doing this, then it was worth it. And I didn’t expect to win; however, I did.”\\n\\nSome of Tarini’s best moments have been spreading awareness about child trafficking, she said. She said she spoke to the Searcy Rotary Club and it was one of her favorite moments. “I talked to the lady who runs the Safe Place in Jonesboro and she’s also on a task force in Little Rock for the trafficking, so I’ve learned a lot. I’ve learned the most by just talking to survivors.”"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.712563Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-13T11:01:00.443952Z", "inner_id": 71, "total_annotations": 2,

tied to child sexual abuse images created with artificial intelligence.\\n\\nCaleb French, 27, was indicted last week on two charges of distribution and possession of child pornography.\\n\\nAn FBI investigation began after Anthaney O'Connor, 31, reported to the Air Force Office of Special Investigations in August that an airman sent him child sexual abuse materials through texts and an app, according to an affidavit written by an FBI agent and filed against O'Connor.\\n\\nThe affidavit doesn't identify the airman. But the dates and descriptions of exchanges between the two men detailed in a criminal complaint against O'Connor match those in a memorandum filed in the case against French, who lives in a dormitory on JBER.\\n\\nBoth men were arrested Dec. 19 and remained in custody Thursday at the Anchorage Correctional Complex.\\n\\nLaw enforcement searched French's dorm and found his phone, laptop and a thumb drive contained \"videos and images depicting sexual abuse of children as young as infants, dating back years,\" according to the memorandum filed by prosecutors in support of his detention.\\n\\nFrench secretly took photos of young children in the community to turn them into AI-generated images, it said. Law enforcement found over 10,000 images of partially clothed children and hundreds of AI-generated pornographic images, the memorandum said.\\n\\nFrench, who does not have children of his own, had searched online for the closest child development centers to him and lived within a short walk from an elementary school, according to the memorandum.\\n\\nHe continued to secretly take photos of children while the investigation was ongoing and remained active on an application that he used to share images of child sexual abuse, the memorandum said. Law enforcement followed French in December to a reindeer farm and watched as he appeared to take photos of a child, it said.\\n\\nInvestigators also looked into O'Connor's devices after he reported receiving the child sex abuse material and found text messages containing images he had created using AI and other illicit materials he had not previously disclosed, a criminal complaint filed against him said.\\n\\nHe told investigators he had a large amount of child pornography stored on his devices and has been engaging in similar conduct for years, a separate memorandum filed against him said.\\n\\nO'Connor is facing four charges, including receipt, distribution and possession of child pornography.\\n\\nProsecutors asked for both French and O'Connor to not be released prior to a trial, citing concerns that both men have engaged in exchanging and viewing child sexual abuse images for years and represent a threat to children in the community.\\n\\nAnother JBER soldier was

Tanaka claimed that the agency's late founder Johnny Kitagawa sexually abused him when he was 15 years old in March 1997 at a hotel in Las Vegas hotel. Iida claimed similar abuse from when he was 14 years old in August 2002. Tanaka also alleged regular abuse from 1997-1998, and Iida stated the same for 2002-2006. The two are each seeking US$50 million in compensatory damages and US$100 million in punitive damages.\\n\\nThe lawsuit holds Kitagawa's niece Julie Keiko Fujishima and other former executives responsible for not taking action despite knowing about the abuse.\\n\\nTanaka was a former member of Kansai Johnny's Jr. Iida was a former member and founder of the boy band Kis-My-Ft2 .\\n\\nThe talent agency previously known as Johnny's and Associates changed its name to STARTO ENTERTAINMENT in in December 2023.

"6770bbd76933901ae1d3cc83"}, "text": "Admitted child rapist and retired Roman Catholic priest Lawrence Hecker has died a little more than a week after he began serving a sentence of life imprisonment, officials said on Friday.\\n\\nHecker, 93, had pleaded guilty on 3 December to charges that he had kidnapped and raped a teenager at a New Orleans church in 1975. He had received a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment on 18 December and, four days later, had been transferred to a Louisiana prison known as Elayn Hunt, according to the state’s department of corrections spokesperson Ken Pastorick.\\n\\nPastorick said Hecker died at about 3am on 26 December, at Elayn Hunt, of what were described as natural causes.\\n\\nHecker’s attorney Robert Hjortsberg said his client was meant to eventually be sent to Louisiana’s maximum-security state penitentiary, which is nicknamed Angola, before his death.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nHjortsberg’s co-counsel, Eugene Redmann, said Hecker’s health had been deteriorating.\\n\\nThe child rape survivor who successfully pursued criminal charges against Hecker said on Friday that he felt “vindicated and free” upon learning of his abuser’s death, which occurred about 15 months after the priest was indicted in the 1975 assault and arrested.\\n\\n“I can’t find any words of kindness for his passing,” the survivor said. “The words ‘may he rest in peace’ are so hollow.\\n\\nCiting an empty feeling that he had been harboring since Hecker’s sentencing, the survivor added: “He received man’s justice, had his freedom taken away for 15 months, now the only prayer I can come up with: I hope he spends eternity in hell after God’s judgment of him.”\\n\\nHecker came to be one of the faces of the New Orleans Catholic church’s decades-old clerical molestation scandal – and had been protected from justice by his religious superiors for most of his life.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nThe survivor who proved to be Hecker’s downfall reported being a student at New Orleans’ St John Vianney high school – named after a patron saint of Catholic parochial priests – when the abusive cleric befriended him.\\n\\nThe survivor had a habit of working out in a weight room fashioned from a space in the bell tower of an adjacent church known to locals as Little Flower, which has since closed alongside St John Vianney, a school that primarily catered to boys interested in joining the Catholic priesthood.\\n\\nOne day, Hecker showed up in the weight room and engaged in small talk with the boy about his dream of joining a St John sports team. Hecker suddenly put the boy – then aged 16 – in a wrestling-style headlock, rendered him unconscious and raped him, according to court filings.\\n\\nThe survivor later recounted telling his mother and school principal about his rape at the hands of Hecker. But, he said, the principal, Paul Calamari, never alerted police and instead threatened to expel him if he did not undergo psychological treatment for what the school leader characterized as “anger issues and fantasy stories”.\\n\\nHecker at first denied those specific allegations. But in 1999, he admitted in writing to Catholic church bureaucrats in New Orleans that he had molested or sexually harassed several other children whom he had met through his work as a priest.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nThe church nonetheless allowed Hecker to return to work a few years before allowing him to retire with full employment benefits. The church then waited until 2018 to finally notify the public that Hecker, Calamari and dozens of their fellow clergymen had been faced with substantial child sexual abuse allegations – all of which collectively prompted New Orleans’ Catholic archdiocese to file for bankruptcy protection less than two years later.\\n\\nAfter the church revealed Hecker to be a child predator, the former St John Vianney student teamed up with a civil attorney, Richard Trahant, to lodge a formal complaint with law enforcement about the survivor’s rape. The case progressed slowly until the summer of 2023, when the Guardian and then New Orleans’ CBS affiliate WWL Louisiana began publishing a series of reports on Hecker’s 1999 confession – as well as actions that the church had taken to hide that disclosure for more than two decades.\\n\\nThe outlets managed to publish those reports despite the fact that the church bankruptcy hid most archdiocesan matters behind a court-mandated seal of confidentiality.\\n\\nFinally, in September 2023, Louisiana state police and the office of the New Orleans district attorney, Jason Williams, obtained a grand jury indictment charging Hecker with child rape, kidnapping and other crimes in connection with the 1975 attack at St John Vianney.\\n\\nThe case was delayed more than a year amid questions about whether Hecker, as a nonagenarian who had been grappling with dementia, had the competence required to legally stand trial. He was deemed competent in the end, setting the stage for a trial that was supposed to start on 3 December.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nRelated: Retired New Orleans priest gets life in prison after pleading guilty to child rape\\n\\nHecker, though, averted the trial by pleading guilty as charged and receiving a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment 15 days later. It marked the first time at least in recent memory that a Catholic clergyman in the city of New Orleans – whose archdiocese counts on hundreds of thousands of congregants – had been convicted of child rape, one of Louisiana’s most harshly punished crimes.\\n\\nThe sentencing hearing left the judge presiding over the case, Nandi Campbell, in tears of sympathy for Hecker’s victims.\\n\\nOne, Aaron Hebert, who had been prepared to testify in support of the former St John Vianney student had the trial proceeded called Hecker “Satan in priest clothing”, someone who stole his childhood from him. Another survivor called Hecker “an animal” and thanked God his day of justice had at last arrived.\\n\\nThe former St John Vianney student testified that his being raped by Hecker had doomed him to a lifetime of disjointed personal relationships – including with his wife and children. “I have zero friends,” he said as Hecker wept and wiped at his eyes. “I pushed everyone away.”\\n\\nThat survivor has since expressed a wish for some of Hecker’s enablers to be prosecuted eventually. It remained to be seen whether that was possible, though a broader investigation spurred by the case against Hecker remains active and ongoing.\\n\\nStatements sworn under oath in April by the state police investigator who primarily built the case against Hecker, Scott Rodrigue, as part of the wider probe explicitly allege that authorities have probable cause to suspect that the archdiocese ran a child sex-trafficking ring responsible for the “widespread … abuse of minors dating back decades”. That abuse was “covered up and not reported” to authorities, Rodrigue’s sworn statements said.\\n\\nNonetheless, at the time of his death, no one other than Hecker had been charged.\\n\\nAfter news of Hecker’s death circulated Friday, Williams said, “We had no time to waste.”\\n\\nWilliams also issued a statement that read in part: “Hecker’s measure of earthly justice was certainly not enough for his crimes. It seems his maker was anxious to meet him after there was no longer any question about his guilt here.”"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.712613Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-16T19:16:06.303229Z", "inner_id": 74, "total_annotations": 2, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60834, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 144951369, "annotations": [{"id": 54575501, "completed_by": {"id": 60833, "email": "sskanuk@gmail.com", "first_name": "", "last_name": ""}, "result": [{"id": "nD_978e-N3", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Incident"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}, {"id": "BpxY92V72g", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Minor", "Physical Abuse/Threat or force", "Psychological Abuse/Threat or Force", "Sexual Abuse"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "coercion_classifier"}, {"id": "8sBQo6UknI", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Friendship/Grooming"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "recruitment_classifier"}, {"id": "r9zNFXFJPc", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "transport_classifier"}, {"id": "GM_aGtDhfF", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Child Sexual Exploitation", "Sexual Exploitation"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_classifier"}, {"id": "tyxm91z5gM", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_sub_classifier"}], "reviews": [], "history": [{"id": 59779640, "comment": null, "organization_id": 34950, "project_id": 122257, "annotation_id": 54575501, "draft_id": null, "review_id": null, "task_id": 144951369, "result": [{"id": "nD_978e-N3", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Incident"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}, {"id": "BpxY92V72g", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Minor", "Physical Abuse/Threat or force", "Psychological Abuse/Threat or Force", "Sexual Abuse"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "coercion_classifier"}, {"id": "8sBQo6UknI", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Friendship/Grooming"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "recruitment_classifier"}, {"id": "r9zNFXFJPc", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "transport_classifier"}, {"id": "GM_aGtDhfF", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Child Sexual Exploitation", "Sexual Exploitation"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_classifier"}, {"id": "tyxm91z5gM", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_sub_classifier"}], "lead_time": 39.522, "action": "submitted", "started_at": "2025-02-16T22:26:28.301000Z", "created_at": "2025-02-16T22:27:08.425313Z", "created_by": 60833, "comment_id": null}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-16T22:27:08.225059Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-16T22:27:08.225077Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-02-16T22:26:38.408731Z", "lead_time": 39.522, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 6, "unique_id": "36a7cdd3-6551-4d5d-a9d0-67214a326f92", "import_id": null, "last_action": "submitted", "bulk_created": false, "task": 144951369, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60833, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": 60833}], "file_upload": "2d869759-batch_5_data.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "agreement": 100.0, "data": {"_id": {"$oid": "6770bbd76933901ae1d3cd14"}, "text": "Morgan Co. couple charged with human trafficking once celebrated for adopting\\n\\nMORGAN COUNTY, Ind.

LCPD believes in making our community a safer place for all residents, especially children. LCPD encourages family members, parents, and friends to work with their children to monitor internet use and educate about the dangers of internet predators.

When Nordsving confronted the boy, he said the behavior escalated, leading him to strike the boy in the mouth with the back of his hand. He admitted to investigators that he struck his son too hard.\\n\\nThe boy later told a child protection worker that he is afraid of Nordsving, and is worried that “Nordsving is going to say that it was the child’s fault and that the child was in trouble,” the complaint says.\\n\\nNordsving is due in court on Dec. 30.

The Hattiesburg police continue to investigate the complaints and have declined to comment.\\n\\nPolice are also investigating a third criminal complaint filed against Wicht. The Mississippi Child Protective Services has previously investigated the matter.\\n\\n“My understanding is the allegations reported to CPS were unsubstantiated,” Reed said. “Of course, Mr. Wicht wholeheartedly denies the allegations.”\\n\\n‘Real love doesn’t do that’\\n\\nIn a sworn statement, a woman, who asked not to be named for fear of retribution, said Wicht sexually abused her during the time he counseled her.\\n\\nThe young woman went to him in 2016 because she was still reeling from a 28-year-old man sexually abusing her when she was 8. “I was the kid who took a shower with my underwear on,” she said.\\n\\nWicht’s counseling helped her immensely, but some of the things he did also disturbed her, she said.

I’m bawling. I’m mad at God.”\\n\\nHe drove to where she was, took her home and insisted she head to the bathroom, she said, but when she did go, he refused to leave the bathroom while she urinated.\\n\\nHe encouraged her to sleep on her parents’ couch, rather than her bedroom, and after she closed her eyes to sleep, she said she felt his hand go down into her jogging pants and underneath her panties.\\n\\nWhen she objected, she said he pulled his hand back out and said, “Oh, it’s OK. It’s OK.”\\n\\nEarlier this year, she said she confronted Wicht about that night, and he said nothing in response.\\n\\nShe had confronted him before, she said, accusing him of being a sex addict. “Your mind is sick, and your heart is seared,” she quoted herself as saying. “You can’t work multiple women over at the same time and call it love. Real love doesn’t do that. You have confused love with something else.”\\n\\nIn response, he wept and spoke of being truly sorry and changed by God, she said. Artwork by a woman who alleges she was sexually assaulted by longtime counselor Wade Wicht.\\n\\nShe credited God, journaling, counseling from others, expressing her feelings through art and distance from Wicht with helping her heal. “There would have been no healing if God hadn’t given me the courage to go to counseling,” she said. “My faith is central to who I am.”\\n\\nUnlike the other women, she has no plans to file a criminal complaint against Wicht because she doesn’t want to go through the same agony she did in testifying against her 28-year-old abuser. She said Wicht’s sexual abuse of her could only be prosecuted as a misdemeanor because Mississippi law requires penetration in order to be classified as a felony.\\n\\nHer past made her an easy target\\n\\nJenny Green is going public with what she said Wicht did to her during counseling sessions.\\n\\n“He’s a free man, and nothing has happened to him,” said Green, who has filed a criminal complaint with Hattiesburg police. “I want to do all I can to help make sure he can’t do anything like that again.”\\n\\nHer past made her an easy target, she said, because she had been sexually abused as a minor.\\n\\nA 17-year-old tomboy who bloomed late, she had few friends, she said.\\n\\nThen a teacher began to stalk her, praised her looks and intelligence, and listened to her share how the only boyfriend she ever had left her for someone else, she said. “He saw someone in a fragile place and pounced.”\\n\\nAt night, he would call and converse, she said, and the words he shared helped fill the emptiness she felt.\\n\\nOne night after returning to school from a track meet, she said the teacher plied her and a girlfriend with wine coolers. It was the first alcohol she had ever had, and she became drunk, she said.\\n\\nThe next thing she knew she was in a bedroom, and he was on top of her, she said. “I was a virgin.”\\n\\nAfterward, she said, “I asked him, ‘Did we just have sex?’ I was clueless.”\\n\\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at least 1 in 4 girls in the U.S. are victims of sexual assault.\\n\\nLike a number of other victims, Green suffered disassociation, she said. “It was almost like I wasn’t in my own body. I didn’t feel like I was there.”\\n\\nSuch disassociation is the brain’s way of placing distance between the victim and the traumatic event, scientists say.\\n\\nShe later wrote poems about what happened.\\n\\nKeep quiet\\n\\nDon’t cry\\n\\nWe can pretend it didn’t.\\n\\nWe can lie.\\n\\nHer teacher told her she must never breathe a word about this, and if she did, he would kill himself. She said she believed him.\\n\\nYour body\\n\\nIt is like none other.\\n\\nIt’s beautiful,\\n\\nBut you must never tell your mother.\\n\\nEach school day, she sat in his class, and when he gazed at her, guilt and shame washed over her , she said. “I thought what the teacher did was my fault.”\\n\\nUnable to sleep, she finally woke her mother to tell her what happened. “I didn’t know how to say, ‘My teacher raped me,’” she said. “I didn’t have the verbiage.”\\n\\nFor the first time in her life, she visited a gynecologist, who determined she wasn’t pregnant.\\n\\nWhen her family decided against pursuing charges, she blamed herself. “I was told to never talk about it,” she said, “and for 20 years, I didn’t.”\\n\\nMarriage counseling gone wrong\\n\\nJenny Green is waiting for prosecutors to decide if they will pursue her criminal complaint against longtime counselor Wade Wicht, accusing him of sexually abusing her during a counseling session. Credit: Jerry Mitchell/Mississippi Today\\n\\nIn April 2021, Green and her husband walked into Wade Wicht’s office.\\n\\nShe had been pushing for marriage counseling, and Wicht was the only counselor her husband would see.\\n\\nWhat the couple didn’t know was that Wicht had already had sex with a client, according to an order from the State Board of Examiners for Licensed Professional Counselors, which oversees and licenses counselors.\\n\\nAfter a few sessions, Wicht suggested separate counseling sessions, she said. Her husband’s sessions lasted 40 minutes or so; hers lasted up to two hours.\\n\\nIn a separate session with Wicht, she said she confessed her nervousness in talking about private matters and joked about needing a drink. She said he poured drinks for both of them — a habit he continued at times.\\n\\nHe steered conversations to the sexual, discussing the size of her breasts and asking if she had implants, she said. When she came to one counseling session after a workout, he questioned why she had a jacket tied around her waist, she said.\\n\\n“Covering up a little bit,” she replied.\\n\\n“Why are you doing that?” she recalled him asking.\\n\\nAnother time, she said he told her, “You need to be careful where your gaze goes. You stare at my crotch.”\\n\\nHis words mortified her, she said, because it was a ridiculous lie.\\n\\nAfter each session, he tried to hug her, and she recoiled. “He said I needed to be comfortable hugging,” she said. “He said I was stiff and uncomfortable.”\\n\\nWhen she showed up one day with coffee, he told her to get him a coffee next time. “He mentioned that again and again,” she said. “I realize now he was seeing what he could get me to do.\\n\\n“He eventually did get me to bring him a coffee. He did eventually get me to hug him.”\\n\\nShe said this was reminiscent of what her teacher did, getting her to bring him a Snickers candy bar and a Coke during each break.\\n\\nThe torment exhausting\\n\\nThe self-doubt to no end\\n\\nThe shame a coat of many colors\\n\\nThe secrets all held within.\\n\\n‘It devastated me’\\n\\nIn October 2021, when her husband talked of possible harm to himself or others, Green said she felt scared and hopeless. She called Wicht’s office, and he rushed to their house.\\n\\nAfter that, her trust and dependence on the counselor “went through the roof,” she said.\\n\\nIn her sessions, she said she confessed to Wicht that she was experiencing some transference, that is, redirecting her feelings from her husband to him.\\n\\nHe responded this could be beneficial for her therapy, she said. “Instead of passing me off to someone else, he used that to his advantage.”\\n\\nThe hugging progressed, she said. He began to hug her from behind and tell her it was therapeutic, she said.\\n\\nHe also put his hand on her knee and told her she needed to learn to say no, and in each session that followed, he touched her knee higher, she said. “Every time he touched me, I froze. I didn’t give consent.”\\n\\nStudies show that many victims of sexual abuse or assault report “freezing.” That’s because fear can block the neural circuits that signal the body to move, scientists say.\\n\\nGreen said Wicht urged her to quit initiating sex with her husband and falsely claimed she suffered from sex addiction. “It devastated me,” she said.\\n\\nWhen Wicht suggested she spend weeks at a treatment center, she said she balked, saying she couldn’t leave her husband and children.\\n\\nHe offered an alternative approach. He said he was a certified sex therapist, and she could do that therapy with him, she said.\\n\\nIn his 2018 letter to the licensing board, Wicht listed Chemical and Process Addictions as an area of certification, but not sex therapy.\\n\\nGreen said Wicht asked her to share intimate details about her past abuse, including whether she bled, she said.\\n\\nWhen she wouldn’t share details about what she liked sexually, he urged her to masturbate so he could observe, she told police in her complaint. She refused.\\n\\nLie to myself or subconscious\\n\\nShould I say?\\n\\nLie like a good girl.\\n\\nBe the perfect prey.\\n\\n‘I became a scared little girl’\\n\\nFour days after Christmas, Green suffered a meltdown. Three family members suffered from serious illness, and memories of her teacher’s abuse haunted her, she said. “I was crying uncontrollably.”\\n\\nIn desperation, she telephoned Wicht, who called her to his office.\\n\\nThis time, when he hugged her from behind, he began to caress her breasts over her clothing, she said. “He said, ‘This is loving touch,’ and I’m just sobbing.”\\n\\nShe continued to reel from depression. In a March 2022 session, she said he asked her to remove her clothes. She had refused to do this before, but this time she said she broke down and gave in, crying the whole time.\\n\\nThe commands he gave her echoed some of the same commands she had been given as a child, she said. “That day at the office, I became a scared little girl. I had no choice but to be compliant. I was the perfect prey.”\\n\\nWicht made her put a blindfold on, made her lie on her stomach and spread her bottom cheeks, and “he proceeded to penetrate me with his fingers,” she told police. When he finished, “he held me and acted as if it had been a caring moment,” she told police. “That was the last time he touched me.”\\n\\nShe froze, just as she had before, she said.\\n\\nOne study showed that 70% of 298 women who came to a rape clinic for treatment reported “paralysis” or an inability to resist during the assault.\\n\\nThroughout Wicht’s abuse, Green told police, “He would remind me I could never in my life breathe a word of it. Said someone could die or be killed if I did. This was triggering as my abuser from teen years threatened to kill himself if I told anyone.”\\n\\nAfter this abuse, she said thoughts of self-harm flooded her mind. She posted the suicide prevention hotline number on her wall, and sometimes slept in the closet.\\n\\nThe stillness. The peace.\\n\\nThe madness. The dire.\\n\\nWhen will it end?\\n\\nI long to expire.\\n\\nAfter the alleged abuse, Green sought treatment from another therapist, whom she said helped rescue her from her despair.\\n\\nShe has since spoken to other of Wicht’s alleged victims, some of whom have yet to file complaints, she said. “He convinced women that they’re damaged, and you’re going to be beholden to him so that you don’t tell anybody,” she said.\\n\\nCounselors have power over their clients, she said. They can groom, lie, manipulate and coerce those they treat into obeying their commands because “we believe we must do as we are told,” she said.\\n\\nIt’s bad enough for a trusted person to exploit you, but when it’s a counselor, who knows so many intimate details about your life, she said, “It rapes every part of your soul and mind.”\\n\\nHow sick\\n\\nAnd how twisted and who\\n\\nThe f— let that happen?\\n\\nKeep quiet\\n\\nDon’t cry\\n\\nWe can pretend it didn’t.\\n\\nWe can lie.\\n\\n‘The law protects the guilty’\\n\\nWicht has already admitted to having sex with two women he counseled, a violation of the ethical code that prompted the loss of his counseling license.\\n\\nOne of those was Kimberly Cuellar, who has filed a criminal complaint against Wicht. She told police that in one counseling session, he had her lay on the floor, pulled down her pants and digitally penetrated her without her consent, claiming it was for his research. She said he continued to touch her sexually in sessions, claiming it was therapeutic.\\n\\nKimberly Cuellar says her journey dealing with Wade Wicht has taught her, more than ever, about God’s amazing grace. Credit: Jerry Mitchell/Mississippi Today\\n\\nIn addition to those allegations, she said he tried to rape her while she was sleeping in her parents’ home in 2023. She said she awoke to him on top of her. “You moved my shorts, and you absolutely tried to get inside me,” she wrote in text exchanges she shared with Mississippi Today.\\n\\n“Omgoodness, what??!! … What you’re accusing me of is criminal, Kimberly! … I touched you with my fingers, and I was touching myself,” he responded. “I was NOT trying to have sex with you while you were sleeping.”\\n\\nShe told him “no” multiple times, but he refused to stop, she wrote. “You then touched me without consent while you ejaculated on my body after all the no’s I had given. Attempted rape? Absolutely.”\\n\\nIn April, another licensed professional counselor in Mississippi, Dr. Philip Raymond Baquie of Oxford, surrendered his license after he admitted having sex with a female client during a counseling session in December 2023.\\n\\nMore than half the states consider sex between mental health professionals and their patients a crime. Mississippi isn’t one of those states.\\n\\nIn 2023, the Mississippi House passed a bill that would have made it a crime for therapists, clergy, doctors and nurses to have sexual contact with those they treat or counsel.\\n\\nBut the bill died in the Senate Judiciary B Committee after some senators questioned the need for a law. Committee Chairman Joey Fillingane has said if something like this happens in a church-affiliated organization, the church can fire that person.\\n\\nBrad Eubank, a pastor for First Baptist Church in Petal who serves on the Southern Baptist Convention’s sex abuse task force, said firing those guilty of sexual abuse isn’t enough.\\n\\n“We must stop this scourge of sexual abuse and put a stop to any counselor, medical professional, social worker or clergy who would take advantage of an individual who finds themselves in a vulnerable state seeking help,” said Eubank, a victim of sexual abuse himself. “We need clear laws with stiff penalties to be a severe deterrent to stop this from ever happening as well as providing justice for those victims when it does happen.”\\n\\nGreen said she’s willing to testify to lawmakers to let them know that when counselors use their power to sexually abuse their clients, they deserve to be punished.\\n\\nBecause there is no videotaping of sessions, the counselor’s office provides “the perfect setting for that crime,” she said. “That’s why there needs to be protection.”\\n\\nThis crime damages victims for life, she said. “Sexual abuse distorts, if not destroys, the victims’ ability to express romantic love in a healthy way. Stealing that part of us should not go without consequences.”\\n\\nUnder Mississippi’s current statute, “the law protects the guilty,” she said. “We as sexual abuse victims don’t stand a chance.”\\n\\nRepublish This Story Republish our articles for free, online or in print, under a Creative Commons license."}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.712763Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-16T19:44:56.432189Z", "inner_id": 83, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60834, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 144951378, "annotations": [{"id": 54574340, "completed_by": {"id": 60834, "email": "ankitamanna1@gmail.com", "first_name": "", "last_name": ""}, "result": [{"id": "fJkL39z8oT", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Incident"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}, {"id": "ijq0Qew8as", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "coercion_classifier"}, {"id": "YD4NsONsq8", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "recruitment_classifier"}, {"id": "dzEXoaVlP2", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "transport_classifier"}, {"id": "b2O-W122bk", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Child Sexual Exploitation"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_classifier"}, {"id": "L7V0uo3UAy", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Online Sexual Exploitation", "Pornography"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_sub_classifier"}], "reviews": [], "history": [{"id": 59778236, "comment": null, "organization_id": 34950, "project_id": 122257, "annotation_id": 54574340, "draft_id": null, "review_id": null, "task_id": 144951378, "result": [{"id": "fJkL39z8oT", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Incident"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}, {"id": "ijq0Qew8as", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "coercion_classifier"}, {"id": "YD4NsONsq8", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "recruitment_classifier"}, {"id": "dzEXoaVlP2", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "transport_classifier"}, {"id": "b2O-W122bk", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Child Sexual Exploitation"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_classifier"}, {"id": "L7V0uo3UAy", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Online Sexual Exploitation", "Pornography"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_sub_classifier"}], "lead_time": 108.572, "action": "submitted", "started_at": "2025-02-16T19:44:57.138000Z", "created_at": "2025-02-16T19:46:46.071246Z", "created_by": 60834, "comment_id": null}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-16T19:46:45.942950Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-16T19:46:45.942958Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-02-16T19:45:54.871206Z", "lead_time": 108.572, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 6, "unique_id": "79c92e02-6926-447f-8bba-fde4c8161786", "import_id": null, "last_action": "submitted", "bulk_created": false, "task": 144951378, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60834, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": 60834}], "file_upload": "2d869759-batch_5_data.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "agreement": 100.0, "data": {"_id": {"$oid": "6770bbd76933901ae1d3cc57"}, "text": "An F-22 Raptor taxis at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, March 9, 2019. (Michael Campbell/U.S. Air Force)\\n\\nDec. 26 (Tribune News Service) — An airman stationed at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson was arrested last week, along with the man who first reported him to law enforcement, on federal charges tied to child sexual abuse images created with artificial intelligence.\\n\\nCaleb French, 27, was indicted last week on two charges of distribution and possession of child pornography.\\n\\nAn FBI investigation began after Anthaney O’Connor, 31, reported to the Air Force Office of Special Investigations in August that an airman sent him child sexual abuse materials through texts and an app, according to an affidavit written by an FBI agent and filed against O’Connor.\\n\\nThe affidavit doesn’t identify the airman. But the dates and descriptions of exchanges between the two men detailed in a criminal complaint against O’Connor match those in a memorandum filed in the case against French, who lives in a dormitory on JBER.\\n\\nBoth men were arrested Dec. 19 and remained in custody Thursday at the Anchorage Correctional Complex.\\n\\nLaw enforcement searched French’s dorm and found his phone, laptop and a thumb drive contained “videos and images depicting sexual abuse of children as young as infants, dating back years,” according to the memorandum filed by prosecutors in support of his detention.\\n\\nFrench secretly took photos of young children in the community to turn them into AI-generated images, it said. Law enforcement found over 10,000 images of partially clothed children and hundreds of AI-generated pornographic images, the memorandum said.\\n\\nFrench, who does not have children of his own, had searched online for the closest child development centers to him and lived within a short walk from an elementary school, according to the memorandum.\\n\\nHe continued to secretly take photos of children while the investigation was ongoing and remained active on an application that he used to share images of child sexual abuse, the memorandum said. Law enforcement followed French in December to a reindeer farm and watched as he appeared to take photos of a child, it said.\\n\\nInvestigators also looked into O’Connor’s devices after he reported receiving the child sex abuse material and found text messages containing images he had created using AI and other illicit materials he had not previously disclosed, a criminal complaint filed against him said.\\n\\nHe told investigators he had a large amount of child pornography stored on his devices and has been engaging in similar conduct for years, a separate memorandum filed against him said.\\n\\nO’Connor is facing four charges, including receipt, distribution and possession of child pornography.\\n\\nProsecutors asked for both French and O’Connor to not be released prior to a trial, citing concerns that both men have engaged in exchanging and viewing child sexual abuse images for years and represent a threat to children in the community.\\n\\nAnother JBER soldier was arrested in August on separate charges tied to AI-generated images of child sex abuse materials.\\n\\n(c)2024 the Alaska Dispatch News\\n\\nVisit the Alaska Dispatch News at www.adn.com\\n\\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC."}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.712780Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-16T19:46:46.022632Z", "inner_id": 84, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60834, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 144951379, "annotations": [{"id": 54574366, "completed_by": {"id": 60834, "email": "ankitamanna1@gmail.com", "first_name": "", "last_name": ""}, "result": [{"id": "Aw7Kb66Bos", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Incident"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}, {"id": "HrBVJTSa8j", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Minor", "Sexual Abuse"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "coercion_classifier"}, {"id": "TWbGZNAuJt", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "recruitment_classifier"}, {"id": "NfChUQ5Sba", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "transport_classifier"}, {"id": "a547tPdhJB", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Child Sexual Exploitation"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_classifier"}, {"id": "bSI8nVmFza", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_sub_classifier"}], "reviews": [], "history": [{"id": 59778264, "comment": null, "organization_id": 34950, "project_id": 122257, "annotation_id": 54574366, "draft_id": null, "review_id": null, "task_id": 144951379, "result": [{"id": "Aw7Kb66Bos", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Incident"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}, {"id": "HrBVJTSa8j", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Minor", "Sexual Abuse"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "coercion_classifier"}, {"id": "TWbGZNAuJt", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "recruitment_classifier"}, {"id": "NfChUQ5Sba", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "transport_classifier"}, {"id": "a547tPdhJB", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Child Sexual Exploitation"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_classifier"}, {"id": "bSI8nVmFza", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_sub_classifier"}], "lead_time": 145.979, "action": "submitted", "started_at": "2025-02-16T19:46:46.705000Z", "created_at": "2025-02-16T19:49:13.083865Z", "created_by": 60834, "comment_id": null}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-16T19:49:12.940117Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-16T19:49:12.940127Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-02-16T19:48:52.566790Z", "lead_time": 145.979, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 6, "unique_id": "8f89091f-5d8d-454c-af28-98985ed38950", "import_id": null, "last_action": "submitted", "bulk_created": false, "task": 144951379, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60834, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": 60834}], "file_upload": "2d869759-batch_5_data.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "agreement": 100.0, "data": {"_id": {"$oid": "6770bbd76933901ae1d3cc58"}, "text": "Infant involved in suspected child abuse case being treated at Omaha hospital\\n\\nA 3-month-old infant at the heart of a suspected child abuse case in Kansas is being treated at an Omaha hospital.

Titled “Two Ways to Fix Income Inequality,” it calls for using government assistance or an increased minimum wage to improve the lot of America’s poor.\\n\\nBut Levine is best-known for the book she wrote 13 years ago, titled Harmful to Minors: The Perils of Protecting Children from Sex. Available in its entirety online, the book takes a host of positions on sexual matters that are at best well outside the American mainstream.\\n\\nLevine describes society’s fear of pedophiles as overblown in the book, and argues child pornography is rarely produced, usually not very pornographic, and not worthy of heavy police pursuit. She also suggests lowering the age of consent and complained American society is too quick to condemn relationships between young teenagers and adults.\\n\\n‘Teens often seek out sex with older people, and they do so for understandable reasons,” Levine wrote in the book. “An older person makes them feel sexy and grown up, protected and special; often the sex is better than it would be with a peer who has as little skill as they do. For some teens, a romance with an older person can feel more like salvation than victimization.”\\n\\nLevine provocatively asks in the book why a child as young as 11 can be tried as an adult for murder, but children of the same age cannot exercise any agency in sexual matters.\\n\\nLast year, Levine condemned the prosecution of seven football players in New Jersey for sexually assaulting younger players, arguing the harm to young minority men from prosecution for sexual assault outweighed any harm they had inflicted.\\n\\n“For kids who are 15 to 17 years old, it will be life crushing,” she wrote, referring to a felony conviction for sexual assault. “Yes, more life-crushing even than being punched, kicked, groped, or subject to an unwanted finger inching into your anus.”\\n\\nSanders himself published an essay in 1972 in which he said women fantasize about being gang-raped, although he has recently defended the writing as a failed attempt at satire.

{"$oid": "6770bbd76933901ae1d3cc78"}, "text": "Congressional Report Documents Atrocities Of China Rule In Tibet\\n\\nWASHINGTON, DC (ANI): The U.S. Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) has released its annual report detailing ongoing human rights abuses in Tibet under Chinese rule. The report highlights the suppression of Tibetan religious, cultural, and ethnic rights, emphasizing severe restrictions on Tibetan Buddhism, the disproportionate targeting of Tibetans in political detentions, and the role of international corporations in facilitating state repression.\\n\\nThe report focuses on the continued crackdown on Tibetan religious practices, particularly Tibetan Buddhism, in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) and other Tibetan-inhabited areas. Chinese authorities have imposed strict bans on religious ceremonies and limited access to monasteries, particularly during significant cultural and religious events. Despite calls for dialogue, Chinese officials have shown little interest in resuming negotiations with the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism, with the last round of talks occurring in January 2010.\\n\\nA significant concern is China’s “sinicization” policy, aimed at restricting Tibetan cultural expression and replacing Tibetan Buddhist practices with state-controlled versions of religion. The report details the forced relocation of monks from monasteries, such as the Atshog Monastery in Dragkar County, due to a hydropower project. Additionally, the creation of residential boarding schools undermines the transmission of Tibetan culture and language across generations.\\n\\nThe CECC report also highlights the disproportionate targeting of Tibetans in the Chinese state’s political repression. Tibetans represent a significant portion of political prisoners in China. Of the 2,764 political prisoners in the CECC’s database, 1,686 are detained for reasons related to religious or cultural affiliations, with Tibetan Buddhists making up the largest religious group among these detainees.\\n\\nFurthermore, the report reveals that of the 1,693 active detentions with available ethnic information, nearly half—790—are ethnically Tibetan, underscoring the ethnic and cultural repression faced by Tibetans under Chinese rule.\\n\\nThe role of U.S. and foreign corporations in facilitating China’s human rights abuses is also discussed. One key example is Thermo Fisher Scientific, whose DNA sequencers were allegedly used by Chinese police to compile DNA databases of Tibetans and Uyghurs. The report raises concerns that this technology could be used for organ harvesting, a long-standing accusation against the Chinese government, particularly regarding Uyghur Muslims.\\n\\nThe CECC report also draws attention to protests in February 2024 in Derge County, Tibet, in response to a planned hydropower dam on the Drichu (Jinsha) River. Locals fear the dam will flood villages and monasteries, including the historic Wontoe 1 Monastery. The report condemns the Chinese government’s displacement plans, which lack meaningful community participation, and highlights the broader environmental and cultural destruction in Tibet caused by infrastructure projects like hydropower dams.\\n\\nAnother key finding is the Chinese government’s efforts to replace Tibetan with Mandarin Chinese in the region. Officials have increasingly adopted “Xizang” (the Mandarin term for Tibet) in English-language communications, a strategy to reinforce Chinese sovereignty over Tibet and erase Tibetan cultural and linguistic identity.\\n\\nThe CECC’s 2024 report paints a bleak picture of Tibet under Chinese rule, documenting severe restrictions on Tibetan religious practices and cultural rights, the targeting of Tibetans in political detentions, and the complicity of international corporations in facilitating these human rights abuses."}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.712866Z",

felony counts of possession of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). The arrest is the result of FDLE’s statewide initiative to locate and arrest criminals sharing files depicting the sexual abuse of children.\\n\\nThe investigation began in November when FDLE received a cyber tip from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), alerting agents to files depicting the sexual abuse of children being uploaded to an online storage platform. The investigation identified Rowe as the account user and his residence as the location where the IP address was being used.\\n\\nFDLE agents served a warrant at Rowe’s residence and seized several electronic devices. A preliminary forensic analysis located multiple files depicting the sexual abuse of children, some as young as 8 years old.\\n\\nRowe was arrested and booked into the Seminole County Jail on Dec 20. The case will be prosecuted by Attorney General Ashley Moody’s Office of Statewide Prosecution.\\n\\nThe investigation was conducted by FDLE’s Orlando Cybercrime unit.\\n\\nPlease visit the FDLE

duo—according to the country’s online media, Bernama— appeared before Magistrate Ain Nurshahira Sahzan, where the charges were read in English.\\n\\nThey are accused under Section 424A of the Malaysian Penal Code, read with Section 34, for possessing and controlling another person’s bank account.\\n\\nAlso, they face charges under Section 6(1)(c) of the Immigration Act 1959/63 for not possessing valid travel documents.\\n\\nThe prosecution, led by Deputy Public Prosecutor Amalina Johar, told the court that both defendants were unrepresented. The court set February 3 as the date for the next hearing and the submission of documents.\\n\\nMeanwhile, a local woman, Normaizatulakmal Mamat, 38, pleaded guilty to being an account mule for online fraud. She admitted to surrendering her ATM card and banking access to another individual involved in the scam.\\n\\nThe court fined her RM250, with a three-day jail term in default.\\n\\nThe arrests stemmed from an incident in mid-December, when the two Nigerian suspects were apprehended at a roadblock in Nilai, Negeri Sembilan, for possessing an ATM card registered to another individual. Subsequent investigations led to the arrest of Normaizatulakmal, the ATM card owner, by the Commercial Crime Investigation Department at the Putrajaya district police headquarters.\\n\\nEgyptian Man Denies Child Abuse Charges\\n\\nIn a separate case, a 37-year-old Egyptian man pleaded not guilty at the Sessions Court to charges of child abuse involving his two young children.\\n\\nThe man is accused of wrapping a telephone cable around the neck of his four-year-old son and throwing his one-year-old daughter onto a bed, causing injuries to both children.\\n\\nThe alleged incident occurred last Tuesday, December 17, at 8:30 a.m., in a rented room on Jalan Maarof, Bangsar, Brickfields.\\n\\nThe charges were brought under Section 31(1)(a) of the Child Act 2001, which stipulates penalties of up to RM50,000 in fines, a maximum prison term of 20 years, or both upon conviction.\\n\\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Joshua Tee Yee Khuan opposed bail, citing the non-bailable nature of the offense and the fact that the accused was unrepresented.\\n\\nSessions Judge Siti Aminah Ghazali adjourned the case to January 20 to allow for document submission and the appointment of legal representation."}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.712916Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-06T13:41:06.010594Z", "inner_id": 92, "total_annotations": 2, "cancelled_annotations": 0,

the Delmas neighborhood of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, Thursday, Dec. 5, 2024. (Odelyn Joseph/AP)\\n\\n(Tribune News Service) — The nine-year-old boys wearing matching knapsacks walk down the street in the morning light, but they are not going to school. In their hands are loaded guns, and the boys know how to use them. One aims his pistol at the Haitian police officers engaging them in a firefight a few hundred yards away. The children are members of one of the gangs that control at least 80% of Port-au-Prince, where they have effectively replaced the government. The knapsacks are for goods they find or loot.\\n\\nIn a country where the United Nations estimates 5,000 people have been killed by gangs this year alone, and more than 700,000 people have been forced to flee their homes, children have become a largely voiceless victim of the crisis. Orphaned, left homeless, or abandoned by families that cannot afford to care for them, many youth roam the streets of the capital before being recruited by gangs that are a rare source of ready cash.\\n\\nThe boys might be used as lookouts or runners to buy cigarettes before being given weapons themselves, said Mary Durran, Haiti program director for Development and Peace— Caritas Canada, a Montreal-based Catholic charity. “The girls are used as sex slaves or as cooks and cleaners.”\\n\\nThe U.N. estimates that the number of children in the ranks of Haiti’s gangs has increased by 70% in the past year, and that children now make up roughly half of the gangs’ fighting force.\\n\\nThe use of child soldiers is considered a war crime by the International Criminal Court.\\n\\n“As the situation in Haiti unfolds, it appears that individuals under the age of 18 are becoming involved in irregular armed forces,” said Theresa S. Betancourt, Salem Professor in Global Practice at the Boston College School of Social Work and author of the forthcoming book Shadows into Light: A Generation of Former Child Soldiers Comes of Age. “So yes, I would say that the situation meets the definition.”\\n\\nHaiti has spiraled into a state of bloody anarchy since the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse in July 2021.\\n\\nShortly after Prime Minister Ariel Henry was barred from the country by threats of violence from the gangs while he was abroad this March, the country was nominally placed under the control of a transitional council with the blessing of the regional Caribbean Community bloc known as CARICOM.\\n\\nBut governmental power on the ground is virtually absent. No elected officials remain in office, the largest prison was virtually emptied in a jailbreak during the gangs’ uprising, and the national police are widely perceived as ineffective, corrupt and brutal.\\n\\nA UN-authorized police force largely composed of Kenyans has been in Haiti since June but a promised 2,500-officer coalition has never numbered more than 416. They have made no major arrests and seized no gang territory.\\n\\nEven before the escalation of violence in the past three years, millions of impoverished Haitian youth faced grim prospects thanks to a “very, very poor educational system with very little investment from the government,” said Durran of Caritas Canada.\\n\\nChildren sent by poor rural families to work as domestics in the cities were sometimes effectively enslaved by their employers.\\n\\nServices for children have been gutted since gangs took over. About 1,000 schools have been closed to use as shelters for displaced persons, or because gangs occupied the area. The pediatric ward of a prominent Port-au-Prince hospital was burned by gangs with Molotov cocktails in mid-December.\\n\\nSeveral orphanages in the capital were forced to relocate to the north of the country when armed groups captured their neighborhoods, said Hunter Picken, an executive with HERO Client Rescue, the armored ambulance and helicopter service that evacuated many orphans.\\n\\nThe gangs don’t spare children in their violent rampages. Amnesty International decried an October massacre in the Artibonite region in which 70 people were killed, including minors.\\n\\nThe enlistment of children as perpetrators of violence is, of course, its own kind of violence. No child joins an armed group voluntarily, said Emmanuel Camille, director of the Haitian child advocacy group KPTSL. Some are forced to join gangs at gunpoint while others are forced by circumstance, but they have all been “manipulated” in one way or another.\\n\\nThe militias use various forms of deception and coercion to enlist young members. A typical recruitment strategy might involve offering a young boy a motor bike or cash, before threatening to denounce him to police or vigilante groups if he ever threatens to defect. Other gangs will give boys more alcohol than they can handle, sometimes laced with drugs, and then film the children in compromising situations to use as blackmail, Camille said.\\n\\nIn a practice seen as particularly horrifying by a country where slaves were once branded with the names of their masters, young members of armed groups are often required to have the name of their gang leader tattooed on their bodies, “like in the time of slavery.”\\n\\nExtracting children from the clutches of gangs is extremely difficult, Camille said. Her organization is working with 30 to 40 children who seem like candidates for defection but has only successfully freed one, a boy of 16. He was from a middle-class family who were determined to save him; he and his parents eventually fled their home for another region of the country with the help of funds from KPTSL. The boy only recently broke off contact with his former bosses in the armed group.\\n\\nToday he is back in school, said Camille, but involvement in brutal violence often leaves children traumatized in a lasting way.\\n\\n“He has a life,” she said, “more or less.”\\n\\n©2024 Miami Herald.\\n\\nVisit miamiherald.com.\\n\\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC."}, "meta": {}, "created_at":

our future\\n\\nBy Rebecca L. Thomas\\n\\nJA Child Welfare Correspondent\\n\\nI am committed to supporting an important mission of child welfare. My parents were social service workers who instilled in me the critical importance of child welfare.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nChild welfare refers to a comprehensive range of social services designed to ensure the safety, security, physical and mental well-being, and healthy development of children. This critical aspect of social care encompasses efforts to protect children from harm, abuse, neglect, and exploitation while providing support and resources to families in need of social and government assistance.\\n\\nUnderstanding Child Welfare\\n\\nChild welfare services aim to address a multitude of issues affecting children, including poverty, homelessness, domestic violence, substance abuse, access to education, basic nutrition, sanitary living conditions, and mental health challenges. These services often involve coordination between various agencies and organizations, such as the Department of Child and Family services (DCFS), foster care support systems, schools, and healthcare providers. It is important for concerned families to know that there are reputable agencies that have been established to support DCFS in placing children in safe homes. No person should feel embarrassed if circumstances in their lives require a temporary reach out to ensure their children have a place to go if relatives are not able to help them. For example, unforeseen accidents can create a void in the family support network necessitating assistance from professionals who are caring and responsive to child welfare.\\n\\nKey components of child welfare include:\\n\\n1. Child Protective Services (CPS): These agencies investigate reports that may come from the public concerning child abuse and neglect, assess the safety of children, and provide interventions to ensure their protection such as placement in the foster care system. CPS workers strive to keep families together when possible and provide resources to help parents overcome challenges.\\n\\n2. Foster Care: When children cannot remain safely in their homes, foster care provides a temporary living arrangement in the home of a licensed family. Foster care families play a vital role in offering stability and care while efforts are made to reunite children with their biological families or find permanent adoptive homes.\\n\\n3. Adoption Services: For children who cannot return to their biological families, adoption offers a permanent solution. Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASAs) are trained on the legal framework for foster care and adoption, and may be a preferred solution for those who are committed through a support network to have longer term engagement in child welfare. As a trainer for CASAs, I have witnessed many successful cases with children in need. Adoption services work to match children with caring and supportive families, ensuring they have the opportunity for a stable and nurturing environment.\\n\\n4. Supportive Programs: Various programs, such as Kids in Need (KIN) in McHenry County and Mimi’s House, aid families in need with tangible resources such as clothing, diapers, baby equipment, and beds. These programs also work to connect foster and adoptive parents with other families through social networking and in-person activities.\\n\\nChallenges and Solutions\\n\\nChild welfare systems face numerous challenges, including high caseloads for social workers, limited resources, and the complex nature of child welfare. Some agencies have been fortunate to receive grants and hire experienced professionals having the capacity and dedication to remain committed to child welfare. Addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach:\\n\\n• Policy and Legislation: Governments at the federal, state, and local level play a crucial role in establishing laws and policies prioritizing child welfare, including funding for social services, ensuring accountability, and protecting the rights of children and families.\\n\\n• Community Involvement: Local communities can support child welfare efforts by providing resources, fostering a culture of awareness, and advocating for vulnerable children who are at risk. Community-based organizations such as churches often collaborate with child welfare agencies to offer additional support.\\n\\n• Education and Training: Continued training and engagement for social workers, educators, healthcare providers, and law enforcement are essential for recognizing signs of abuse and neglect and understanding best practices for intervention.\\n\\n• Prevention and Early Intervention: Focusing on prevention and early intervention can significantly reduce the incidence of child abuse and neglect. Schools and educators play an important role in this initiative. Programs providing support to expectant mothers, early childhood education, and home visitation can help families build strong foundations and deal more effectively with life’s challenges.\\n\\nSome recent child welfare legislation:\\n\\n• Supporting America’s Children and Families Act (H.R. 9076)\\n\\no This bipartisan bill passed the U.S. House of Representatives in September 2023. It reauthorizes Title IV-B of the Social Security Act, which provides funding for child welfare programs. The bill includes new resources for recruiting and retaining child welfare workers, i.e., DCFS, and more flexibility for families experiencing poverty.\\n\\n• Federal Register rule\\n\\no Published in September 2023, this rule allows Title IV-E agencies to set different licensing standards for foster family homes of relatives than for non-relative foster family homes. Note: Foster care licensing is state specific and may be non-transferable. The rule also requires that eligible children receive the same amount of foster care maintenance payments regardless of where they are placed.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nChild welfare is a collective responsibility requiring collaboration across various sectors of society. All of us who can should do our part to support child welfare. By prioritizing the safety, health, and well-being of children, we can ensure a brighter future for the next generation while creating more harmony in society. Through a combination of effective policies, community support, and dedicated professionals, we can create a world where all children can thrive."}, "meta": {}, "created_at":

We’ve heard a lot of Orwellian doublespeak, such as calling abortion “women’s health care,” but we don’t buy into calling puberty blockers and hormones “medicine.” Medicines are meant to treat illness, and it looks like this is a healthy young boy.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThose who convinced him someone’s going to come up and shoot him really should be ashamed of themselves. Forbes reported that 350 trans people were murdered in 2024. Forbes got its number from Transgender Europe’s Trans Murder Monitoring project, and that 350 number is worldwide, not national. “Yet again the report found that most victims were Black and migrant trans women of colour and trans sex workers.” Forbes doesn’t tell us if every one of these people was murdered for being trans, or if they were murdered by other trans or nonbinary people in their lives.\\n\\nShouldn’t mom be more worried her son will commit suicide if he can’t get his life-saving medicine under Trump?\\n\\nWhy this mother is doing this to her child is beyond me… pic.twitter.com/ksRokhSGTc — Defiant L’s (@DefiantLs) December 26, 2024\\n\\nCNN is fully indulging it …\\n\\nThis is completely on the parents.

"6770bbd76933901ae1d3ca23"}, "text": "Texas – In a deeply disturbing case out of Texas, a 55-year-old woman, identified as R. Anderson, faces severe legal consequences after she was arrested for subjecting a 7-year-old girl in her care to cruel and inhumane treatment. The girl, related to Anderson, was reportedly restrained with zip ties, had her mouth duct-taped shut, and was locked in a dog cage for extended periods.\\n\\nThe horrifying events unfolded in Anderson’s apartment around December 13. According to court documents, Anderson, who was the sole caregiver of the child at the time, has been charged with felony counts of unlawful restraint and injury to a child. The charges stem from Anderson’s alleged actions of physically restraining the child by force to such an extent that it substantially interfered with her liberty and wellbeing.\\n\\nProsecutors detail that Anderson not only locked the child in a dog cage but also subjected her to physical abuse by kicking her while she was confined. The complaint highlights the severity of the neglect, noting that the child was left without access to food, water, and a bathroom, leading her to soil herself. This treatment was a “disciplinary measure” by the woman because the child misbehaved at school.\\n\\nThe arrest was prompted by an electronic tip that led to the intervention of the authorities. Upon investigation, the sheriff’s office arrested Anderson last weekend. She was processed at the county’s jail and later released on a $5,000 bond. Following her release, specific conditions were set, including Anderson’s requirement to appear personally for all court dates and prohibitions against engaging in any conduct that could result in arrest or involve threatening, harassing, or assaulting the young victim.\\n\\nThe Texas Department of Family Services has taken the child into protective custody, placing her in foster care where she is reportedly receiving necessary care. “CPS is investigating these abuse allegations alongside law enforcement,” said M. Lanford, a spokesperson for the department. This statement underscores the seriousness with which this case is being treated and the priority given to the child’s safety and recovery.\\n\\nThe community and child welfare advocates have expressed shock and outrage over the case, highlighting the need for vigilance and proactive measures to protect vulnerable children. The support from child protection services has been a crucial aspect of ensuring the victim’s welfare following the traumatic experience. As the case continues to develop, Anderson is scheduled to appear in court again next year, on January 6. The legal proceedings are closely watched by the community, with many hoping for justice to be served to deter similar instances of child abuse.\\n\\nFurthermore, experts have pointed out that stress is often a contributing factor in such abuse cases. They emphasize the importance of strong support networks and available parenting resources to help caregivers manage stress and employ appropriate disciplinary measures without resorting to abuse.

Indian entities allegedly involved in a large-scale human trafficking network.\\n\\nAs per the ED, it's investigation in a case revealed that \"around 112 colleges based in Canada have entered into agreement with one entity and more than 150 with another entity.\"\\n\\n\"Further, it is gathered that there are around 1700 agents and partners of based in Gujarat and around 3500 agents and partners of other entity all over India and out of which around 800 are active,\" ED said in a statement.\\n\\nThe revelation comes during the investigation of a case ED initiated on the basis of First Information Report registered by DCB, Crime Branch, Ahmedabad City, Gujarat against Bhavesh Ashokbhai Patel and others after a family of four Indian national of Dingucha village, Gujarat was found dead on Canada-US Border January 19, 2022.\\n\\nED's Ahmedabad Zonal Office had also conducted search operations on December 10 and 19 under the provisions of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002 at eight locations in Mumbai, Nagpur, Gandhinagar and Vadodara as part of its ongoing probe in the case of Bhavesh Ashokbhai Patel and others (Dingucha case) for hatching a well-planned conspiracy, to send the victims and persons to USA through Canada via illegal channel thereby committing the offence of human trafficking.\\n\\n\"During the course of search operations bank accounts to the tune of Rs 19 lakh were also frozen along and various other incriminating documents and digital devices have been seized,\" said the ED.\\n\\nFurther, two vehicles were also seized, added the agency.\\n\\nAs per the ED, all the accused, in conspiracy with each other, lured the \"innocent Indian Nationals by charging them huge amount of Rs 55 to 60 lakh per person, for causing them to illegally enter USA through Canada.\"\\n\\nED investigation claimed that for sending, \"The Indian National (s) to USA illegally, the accused arranged admission of the individuals in colleges and Universities based in Canada and thereby applied for students' visa for Canada. Once the individuals and students reach Canada, instead of joining the college, they illegally crossed the US-Canada Border and never joined college(s) in Canada.\"\\n\\n\"In view of it, the fee received by colleges based in Canada was remitted back to the individuals' account. It is gathered that two entities based in Mumbai and Nagpur have entered into agreement for admission of students in universities based in foreign countries on commission basis with an entity, which was contacted by a desirous student for immigrating to USA illegally,\" said the federal agency.\\n\\n\"It is revealed during searches conducted that around 25,000 students are being referred by one entity and more than 10,000 students by another to various colleges based outside India every year,\" added the agency.

the name of their pimps: Human trafficking victims tell of their torture at hands of three brothers who ‘treated them like property’\\n\\nFor some unlucky women each day is a horror filled nightmare of helplessness at the hands of violent slimy men, like these 3 brothers Benito Lopez-Perez, Anastasio Romero-Perez and Jose Barrientos-Perez [pictured below] who treat women like chattle.\\n\\nVictims of a sex trafficking trio of brothers from Mexico have finally spoken out about the horrors they faced while held captive. A woman named Carmen, who was forced into sex slavery at just 14-years-old, and another unnamed woman were taken from a Mexican town fast becoming infamous for being the source of unwilling prostitutes. The two women told the New York Daily News their life in New York was ‘hell,’ and that they were forced to have sex with dozens of men each day. ‘I can only describe my life in New York as five years in hell,’ said Carmen. The three brothers who captured her and dozens of others have been sentenced to jail for pimping out and abusing the women, Carmen was pimped out by 35-year-old Benito Lopez-Perez. ‘From the day I arrived in New York until the day I escaped, Benito forced me to work seven days a week,’ she said. ‘I was just merchandise for him. His associates, his clients treated me as an animal.’ Carmen was ferried around the tri-state area and forced to have sex with men in their homes and with seasonal workers in rural areas of Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, she testified in court, according to the paper. The depraved pimp forced her to have sex with as many as 60 men in one day. ‘At the end of the day I was bleeding and in great pain caused by these men,’ she recalled, adding that he would savagely beat her if she wasn’t out earning money. Carmen hoped her tormentor would beat her to death. ‘I was upset because he hadn’t killed me and that I had to live another day of torture,’ she said. The other victim was forced by Anastasio Romero-Perez, 50, to tattoo his name on her stomach, she told the paper. She was his property. Another brother, Jose Gabino Barrientos-Perez, 50, was in on the scheme, but only found guilty of stashing hookers in various apartments in the city’s five boroughs. The three brothers come from the south-central Mexican town of Tenancingo. It was once referred to by the BBC as ‘the town sex trafficking built.’\\n\\nA Mexican charity cited by the BBC estimated that 1,000 of the 10,000 people living in the city are sex traffickers, and various other reports have discovered a ‘pipeline’ of indigenous Mexican women smuggled into New York from Tenancingo. It is that background that led the brothers’ lawyer to claim in court that Lopez-Perez ‘is not a monster,’ but victim of circumstance. ‘Perhaps because we never had the opportunity to be anything better in life,’ Romero-Perez claimed during his trial. He and Lopez-Perez were locked up for 18 years, their elder brother received 10 years. The trio will be deported at the end of their sentences.\\n\\nIt is no wonder that the sex trafficking industry is soaring,: as the pornography industry continues to grow. There is only so long a sex addict can hide in front of a computer before their voracious addiction seeks out something more tangible.\\n\\nAs the mother of an 11 year old last year, I heard some stats that shook me. 2: in 3 boys have seen porn by the time they are 11 and only 3% of boys have not seen porn by the time they reach 18. Many studies revealed that watching porn affects the bio chemistry of an adolescent; porn infiltrates the addiction centers of teens more strongly than that of adults. I discovered that an epidemic of depression and addiction is rising among young boys as a result. This rise in sexual addictions at this early age will inevitably contribute to sex slavery. Fight this on your own turf! Muster the courage to discuss pornography with your young child, don’t wait.\\n\\nAfter getting those stats,I picked my son up from school, took him to ice cream and had a very frank discussion about naked women and porn. I started out with sharing the stats and effects of porn on the chemistry of the brain ie actual physical reaction.: My son was filled with relief to hear that he wasn’t alone in his curiosity. I told him that his feelings of curiosity about women are totally natural but need to be curbed. I gave him some important rules to protect himself: against porn:\\n\\n1. If you see an image that you feel compelled to click on- turn off the computer/TV immediately\\n\\n2. Get up from the computer/TV.\\n\\n3. Get a glass of cold water.\\n\\n4. Increase your activity by taking a walk, singing a song: or other physical activity to: use up energy and concentration.\\n\\n5. Talk to: someone if you can’t stop thinking about it.\\n\\nThose steps above will work for anyone at any age. Porn is a drug that releases chemicals to the body creating addictive behavior, triggers: loneliness, depression and: creates a : skewed description of intimacy that can damage current and future relationships.\\n\\nI need to add some of my research for parents. On Pokémon type: websites the ads will take your children to cartoon porn. My son has not clicked onto this but you should definitely make your kids aware and make the rule to NEVER click on sidebar ads. Here is a picture of one:\\n\\nClicking on the ad strip: like those above: will lead you or a small child\\n\\nwww.FALY.com or this site www.holtgames.com :\\n\\nIt offers your child games like naughty teacher or naughty babysitter. You play tricks on the women to lift their skirt or: trick them in compromising situations and positions. The graphics are obviously created for children and meant to lead children there but the maturity level are for adults. The purpose is to stir sexual feelings and increase kids curiosity. I have seen these sidebars only on children websites, my son is not allowed to visit websites with these ads. As a parent you should set a rule for yourself to never let your child on internet out of your eyesight.\\n\\nSee also,\\n\\nVictim of sexual abuse confronts her 7th grade teacher on video; video goes

session of Congress gave the green light last Thursday after withdrawing those of Ione Belarra its threat to overthrow it, includes a very important measure for violence against girls, boys and adolescents: the creation of specialized courts in these cases in the style of what has happened with gender violence since 2005, a model that the Government plans to apply also to mistreatment of minors.\\n\\nTen years that end in nothing: how a judicial process full of impunity affects a victim of child abuse\\n\\nThis is a provision contained in the child protection law that came into force in June 2021 and which mandated the Executive to present a bill within one year to launch these judicial bodies, whose owners will be trained specifically for these cases. The measure, agreed upon by the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Youth and Children, was presented a few months later, but the 2023 electoral call left it in the air until March of this year – almost two years after the set deadline and three years after the entry into force of the law. And about to end 2024 it has been approved in extremis with the opposition of the PP, which tried to veto it in the Senate.\\n\\nThe text specifies that “the reality of violence” against minors makes this adaptation of justice “urgent.” According to the latest data, in 2022 the ANAR Foundation carried out 17,896 services to children, of which almost 40% reported some type of violence, from physical or psychological abuse to bullying and abandonment. Furthermore, 43% of the victims of sexual assault reported in Spain are minors, according to the latest report of the Ministry of the Interior. Other recent study of the Mutua Madrileña Foundation points out that three out of every four minors have suffered some episode of sexual violence in the digital sphere.\\n\\nFurthermore, the number of minors seeking help for gender violence has grown in recent years, as ANAR has also detected: both adolescent girls who suffer it firsthand and, above all, boys and girls who experience it in their homes. of their parents. Since 2013, 62 minors have been murdered for this reason, nine this year. In these cases, the new law specifies that the Violence against Women courts will have jurisdiction.\\n\\nHowever, the new bodies will be inserted into the new judicial structure inaugurated by the law and whose main novelty is that it leaves behind the single-person courts to create the so-called Courts of Instance, of which there will be one per judicial district and will be made up of different sections. made up of one or more judges. This means that the current 3,800 courts will become 431 Courts. In them there will be sections of Civil and Instruction and the rest can be from any of the possible specialties, among them: Commercial, Criminal, Family, Minors (for cases in which the accused is one), Violence against Women , or now also, Violence against Children and Adolescents.\\n\\nSpecialization according to “workload”\\n\\nThe law fails to establish a minimum number of sections of the latter type that must exist in each Court of Instance, judicial district or province. And its creation will depend on the “workload” in each one. The sections may extend their jurisdiction to two or more parties in the same province and in those places where a specific section has not been created, one of the Investigative Judges will be in charge of processing cases of violence against boys, girls and adolescents, “either exclusively or also knowing about other subjects,” the norm details.\\n\\nThis is one of the issues that most concerns organizations in defense of children’s rights, which have celebrated the incorporation of specialized justice as “a fundamental step”, but regret that this is “optional” depending on the number of children. cases. “It is a very important advance and that is the first thing, but there is no number or concrete reference to how many have to be created, we will have to see how it is implemented so that there is no territorial inequality, but we believe that specialization should have been ensured in all the Courts of Instance and judicial levels,” says Carmela del Moral, head of childhood policies at Save the Children.\\n\\nThe Secretary of State for Justice, Manuel Olmedo, assumes that specialization is not going to reach everywhere, but points out that it is “a first step” in the face of a reality, that of violence against minors, “very invisible.” ” that needs to be judged “with a childhood perspective” and by legal operators “trained for it.”\\n\\nThe General Council of the Judiciary is the one that has a period of seven months to design the specialized training course while the Government and the communities with jurisdiction in justice will have to implement training for the psychosocial teams that advise the courts. “It is necessary that they understand how violence against children works and its specific characteristics, for example, that a minor ends up forgetting part of what happened as time passes or that sometimes they are not able to give details,” he adds.\\n\\n“The next step is to do a workload study and from there establish what is needed. In medium and large judicial districts there will be specialized sections. In some, like Madrid or Barcelona, ​​there will be several judges, in other medium-sized ones there will be one, and in small ones, the investigating judge will have powers and will see all types of cases,” explains Olmedo, who, given the lack of specific deadlines in the law to establish With the specialization underway, it plans to have the study by “the end” of 2025 because “the global organizational change” of the new standard “must be implemented first.”\\n\\nFor its part, the Ministry of Youth and Children highlights that this is “one of the most substantial advances in the development” of the child protection law because “it establishes a reform of the judicial system that, for the first time, adapts to its needs” and recognizes that “the main challenge is to get it started as soon as possible.” Regarding whether territorial inequality can be generated, the department directed by Sira Rego points out that its commitment is to create specialized sections “in all lower courts” or at least in all provinces, but admits that “there are objective criteria based on the workload.” Even so, he believes that specialization will be achieved “progressively” and gives as an example experiences such as the first specialized court in Spain, already created in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria.\\n\\nThe model of gender violence\\n\\nThis is a model that already works for sexist violence, in which whether a case is heard by a specialized judge depends on the victim’s zip code because they do not exist everywhere. 20 years after its launch, up to 14 provinces still do not have this type of bodies, which tend to be concentrated in large cities. Their creation is also “justified based on the workload,” the Government recently said, which means that today up to 36.3% of women do not have access to them despite the fact that they are more trained and judged. adapted for victims and who usually have more material and personal means.\\n\\nThe alternative that the Executive is giving in this situation is the so-called regionalization, which in practice implies that the specialized courts extend their scope of action and cover more territory, but it is an option that raises conflicting opinions. Olmedo maintains that “it is giving very good results” and that some negative effects, such as keeping victims away from the courts, can be counteracted with “the use of new technologies that allow them not to travel.” “We have previous experience of gender violence and, although it is not going to happen overnight because it is a process, this is going to help us with childhood,” says the Secretary of State.\\n\\nAs with violence against women, these courts – from now on, sections – will investigate cases and sentence minor crimes and when there is compliance. In addition, they may adopt precautionary measures and will be responsible for all crimes that involve violence, from homicide to injuries, crimes against freedom or privacy, torture or sexual crimes, among others. In this sense, there are also positions in the Criminal sections – which deal with cases when the sentence exceeds five years in prison – that will specialize, but, again, “according to the number of existing cases.”\\n\\nRepairing the damage caused by child sexual violence in Spain costs more than 4 billion euros a year\\n\\n\\n\\nSave the Children calls for “strengthening the model by ensuring specialization” and remembers that the courts “is one more step” along with other measures such as the generalization of pre-constituted evidence, that is, that the minor’s testimony be recorded to avoid that he must repeat his statement several more times, and the implementation of the Barnahus model, which aims to centralize the entire process in a single friendly space for children, preventing them from having to travel between police stations and courts. “The objective of all this is for justice to be more adapted to the needs of children and to prevent the judicial process from being what it has been until now, which, far from being restorative, often re-victimizes,” says Del Moral."}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.713277Z", "updated_at":

cycle\\n\\nChild labour remains a grave issue in Pakistan. According to Pakistan’s first National Child Labour Survey (1996), approximately 3.3 million children are trapped in this cycle of exploitation. These children are forced to work in domestic labour, brick kilns, carpet weaving, agriculture and even begging, depriving them of their fundamental rights to education, health, and a safe childhood. This exploitation perpetuates a devastating cycle of poverty and illiteracy, hindering the nation’s socio-economic growth.\\n\\nMany of these children endure severe physical and sexual abuse in workplaces, resulting in long-term psychological and emotional scars. Physical abuse, such as beating and overwork, harms their developing bodies, while sexual exploitation leaves them traumatized, often silenced by threats and shame. These experiences severely impact their mental health, leading to anxiety, depressiona, low self-esteem, and the loss of their basic human dignity.\\n\\nAddressing this crisis demands the serious attention of concerned authorities. The government must first enforce existing child labour laws with stricter penalties for violations. Public awareness campaigns can highlight the importance of education and the detrimental consequences of child labour. NGOs and international organizations should collaborate to provide free education and vocational training, offering these children a pathway out of poverty. Lastly, counseling and rehabilitation programs are crucial to help child labour survivors reintegrate into society with dignity and confidence.\\n\\nZUNAIRA ZAFAR\\n\\nSohawa\\n\\nMental health of adolescents\\n\\nAdolescence, spanning the ages of 10 to 19, is a critical period for developing social and emotional habits that form the foundation for lifelong mental well-being. Unfortunately, this age group is increasingly vulnerable to mental health issues, including depression, anxiety and behavioral disorders. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a staggering 14% of adolescents—one in seven—experience mental health problems. Compared to past decades, depression rates among adults have risen significantly. This raises a critical question: what factors are driving this alarming trend in adolescent mental health?\\n\\nThe digital age has undoubtedly contributed to the surge in mental health issues. Excessive use of mobile phones and social media are major culprits, fuelling depression and anxiety among adolescents. The shift from physical interactions to online engagement has led to unhealthy comparisons and distorted self-images, ultimately culminating in mental health disorders. The consequences are dire: suicide rates among teenagers have risen alarmingly. It is imperative that parents, teachers, and governments take immediate action to prevent such tragedies.\\n\\nParents must prioritize quality time with their children, engaging in open conversations about mental health and well-being. Schools should implement policies banning mobile phones during school hours, promoting a healthier learning environment. Furthermore, governments can enact legislation to regulate children’s exposure to digital media, ensuring a safer online ecosystem.\\n\\nMUZAMIL KALHOR\\n\\nNasirabad, Sindh\\n\\nCorporate social responsibility\\n\\nPicture a child growing up near a polluted river, unable to access clean water or envision a brighter future—this is the reality for many in Pakistan, where CSR can transform despair into hope, can provide practical solutions to the challenges experienced by marginalized people and the pressing environmental issues. Companies operating within our borders must recognize their responsibility to invest in humanity and actively contribute to the welfare of society.\\n\\nEthical business practices and philanthropy are central components in this transformation. Regrettably, fair wages remain elusive for millions of Pakistani workers; with industries in many instances exploit labour to cut costs. For example, the garment and textile sector—Pakistan’s largest export industry—has faced international criticism for unfair labour practices. Ensuring equitable wages and safe working conditions could uplift thousands of families and strengthen our economy through advancing the quality of productivity and morale among workers.\\n\\nThe environmental cost of corporate negligence is evenly problematic. Pakistan ranks among the most vulnerable countries to climate change. In spite of this, industries are unabated in their river pollution, deplete natural resources and emit harmful greenhouse gases. The 2022 floods, worsened by climate change, disastrously impacted millions of lives. Businesses like Tetra Pak Pakistan, which focuses on sustainable packaging and renewable energy, offer an example of how industries can innovate while reducing their environmental impact.\\n\\nSHAHJAHAN MEMON\\n\\nIslamabad"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.713311Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-12T13:22:32.788898Z", "inner_id": 115, "total_annotations": 2,

The AFP recommended parents check the games their children play, who they interact with, and the content they access to prevent exposure to harmful material.\\n\\nASIO Chief Mike Burgess noted that online radicalisation is becoming a key challenge in counter-terrorism efforts. “We are seeing more cases of youth radicalisation online,” Burgess told a Senate committee. “A community-wide response is needed to address this issue, as ASIO alone cannot manage the growing threat.”\\n\\nParents concerned about their children’s online safety are encouraged to contact the National Security Hotline or local police for guidance. AFP’s Broader Success in 2024 The AFP’s efforts to combat various forms of crime in 2024 extend beyond terrorism.\\n\\nThe agency has charged over 790 individuals across a range of offences, from cybercrime to child exploitation. Notably, the AFP responded to around 20,000 incidents at airports, charging 1,062 people with offences related to drugs, weapons, assaults, and money laundering.\\n\\nA particular area of concern has been the rise in reports of modern slavery and human trafficking. In 2024, the AFP received a record number of 382 reports related to forced marriage, forced labour, and sexual exploitation, reflecting a 12 percent increase over the previous year.\\n\\nOne of the AFP’s most significant operations in 2024 was Operation Kraken, which targeted a global encrypted communication platform called “Ghost.” This platform, allegedly used by criminals to coordinate illicit activities, was infiltrated by AFP technical experts. The operation resulted in 52 charges and the seizure of 230 kg of illicit drugs, 29 firearms, and $3.4 million in cash.\\n\\nActing Commander Bill Polychronopoulos emphasised the AFP’s commitment to dismantling organised crime networks. “Operation Kraken is just one example of our resolve to tackle serious crime, wherever it occurs,” he said. Espionage and Cybercrime Challenges The AFP also tackled espionage in 2024, charging an Australian couple under new laws introduced in 2018. The couple allegedly shared Australian Defence Force material with Russian authorities and were arrested in Brisbane. This marked the first espionage charge since the law’s introduction.\\n\\nAnother significant AFP operation involved cybercrime. Under Operation Nebulae, the AFP, in coordination with international partners, shut down a phishing platform used by criminals to steal personal data from over 94,000 Australians.\\n\\nThe takedown led to the arrest of 37 individuals globally, underscoring the AFP’s commitment to combating cybercrime.\\n\\nDespite the challenges, Polychronopoulos said that the AFP would not slow down during the holiday season. “Our work is never done,” he said."}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.713327Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-12T13:34:03.598775Z", "inner_id": 116, "total_annotations": 2,

inappropriate and unwanted contact, or online grooming and sextortion to produce child abuse material.\\n\\nEducation is the key to winning the battle, according to the crime agencies that have partnered this Summer to produce the “Child Online Safety Fact Sheet”.\\n\\nIt can be found at esafety.gov.au/parents/resources.\\n\\nCrime Stoppers (NSW), the NSW Police Force, the eSafety Commissioner, and the Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation (ACCCE), which is led by the Australian Federal Police, are taking a coordinated approach to safeguarding children.\\n\\nThey are doing this by ensuring parents, carers and educators understand and manage the challenges.\\n\\nDetective Superintendent Jayne Doherty is the Commander of the NSW Police Sex Crimes Squad and Child Exploitation Internet Unit.\\n\\nShe believes society has to change the way it looks at children’s use of the internet.\\n\\n“The internet is just like the real world. There are places your children can go by themselves and places you should go with your child,” she said.\\n\\n“No matter what, you should always know who your kids are speaking to online and ensure they are prepared for what they may encounter and who to turn to if something bad happens.\\n\\n“Crime Stoppers CEO Peter Price, warns that there are no boundaries when it comes to sexual offenders online and there is no single demographic targeted.\\n\\n“What is common is children being alone online and not having the knowledge or maturity to understand or manage the online space.”\\n\\n“Our priority for our most vulnerable will always be prevention.”\\n\\neSafety Deputy Commissioner Toby Dagg said that, “helping children navigate the online world is probably the most important thing parents and carers can do.”\\n\\neSafety recently released nationally representative data of Australian children aged between eight and twelve-years-old. It reveals:\\n\\n– 84 percent have used social media and messaging services since the beginning of the year.\\n\\n– 93 percent of twelve-year-olds used social media before reaching the current official age for social media entry.\\n\\n– 80 percent of children with a current social media or messaging account had help in setting it up.\\n\\n– Of these, 90 percent said they had assistance from a parent or carer.\\n\\nACCCE and Human Exploitation Commander Helen Schneider said the holiday season was often busy for parents and carers, but “having open and honest conversations can help your child understand the risks and confide in a trusted adult if they are faced with unsafe situations online.\\n\\n“When something happens, young people should seek help as soon as possible and know that, with help, they can make it stop.”\\n\\nIf it does happen there are three key steps:\\n\\n1. Collect evidence. Get screenshots or photos of the conversation/s. Record details such as profiles, usernames and URLs.\\n\\n2. Block the user and report it on the platform where the contact occurred.\\n\\n3. Report it as soon as possible to ACCCE. Details can be found at accce.gov.au/report\\n\\nCase studies\\n\\nThe consequences of not prioritising prevention are painfully real. Documented case studies include:\\n\\n– A 13-year-old female was playing an online game and was talking to a person in the in-game chat. The person manipulated the girl to continue talking on another platform and then tricked her into performing acts with no clothes on. Source: Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation.\\n\\n– A 15-year-old male joined a video call on a messaging app from someone they thought was a person their own age. The boy was tricked into sending images of himself with no clothes on, and the other person started to blackmail the boy for money, threatening to share the images with his family. Source: Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation.\\n\\n– A 12-year-old child received a request on Instagram to follow an unknown person who posed as an 18-year-old. This person groomed the child over a three-week period and asked for information such as their age and address. The child shared self-generated child sexual exploitation material, which was then posted across a platform’s public group chat dedicated to displaying such material. eSafety reported the material to the platform, the material was removed, and the group chat was suspended for violating the platform’s Terms of Service.

Notably, the AFP responded to around 20,000 incidents at airports, charging 1,062 people with offences related to drugs, weapons, assaults, and money laundering.\\n\\nA particular area of concern has been the rise in reports of modern slavery and human trafficking. In 2024, the AFP received a record number of 382 reports related to forced marriage, forced labour, and sexual exploitation, reflecting a 12 percent increase over the previous year.\\n\\nOne of the AFP’s most significant operations in 2024 was Operation Kraken, which targeted a global encrypted communication platform called “Ghost.” This platform, allegedly used by criminals to coordinate illicit activities, was infiltrated by AFP technical experts. The operation resulted in 52 charges and the seizure of 230 kg of illicit drugs, 29 firearms, and $3.4 million in cash.\\n\\nActing Commander Bill Polychronopoulos emphasised the AFP’s commitment to dismantling organised crime networks. “Operation Kraken is just one example of our resolve to tackle serious crime, wherever it occurs,” he said.\\n\\nEspionage and Cybercrime Challenges\\n\\nThe AFP also tackled espionage in 2024, charging an Australian couple under new laws introduced in 2018. The couple allegedly shared Australian Defence Force material with Russian authorities and were arrested in Brisbane. This marked the first espionage charge since the law’s introduction.\\n\\nAnother significant AFP operation involved cybercrime. Under Operation Nebulae, the AFP, in coordination with international partners, shut down a phishing platform used by criminals to steal personal data from over 94,000 Australians.\\n\\nThe takedown led to the arrest of 37 individuals globally, underscoring the AFP’s commitment to combating cybercrime.\\n\\nDespite the challenges, Polychronopoulos said that the AFP would not slow down during the holiday season. “Our work is never done,” he said."}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.713363Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-12T13:53:38.540633Z", "inner_id": 118, "total_annotations": 2,

boys and kept photos and videos of the horrific rapes.\\n\\nGay Georgia couple will spend life in prison for sick abuse of their adopted sons\\n\\nWilliam Zulock (right) and Zachary Zulock, a married gay couple, were each sentenced to 100 years in prison for sodomizing their young sons\\n\\nTwo Georgia men who were convicted in the sickening sex abuse of their two adopted sons are headed to prison for the rest of their lives.\\n\\nA judge decided that married gay couple William and Zachary Zulock – once darlings of the LGBTQ scene in Georgia – will each serve 100 years in prison for sodomizing their young sons, recording the sex acts and providing videos of the abuse to other pedophiles, 11Alive reported.\\n\\nThe horrific abuse was believed to take place when the boys were as young as three and five years old.\\n\\n‘These two defendants truly created a house of horrors and put their extremely dark desires above everything and everyone else,’ Alcovy Judicial Circuit District Attorney Randy McGinley said at their sentencing.\\n\\n‘However, the depth of the defendants’ depravity, which is as deep as it gets, is not greater than the resolve of those that fought for justice and the strength of the victims in this case.\\n\\n‘The resolve I have seen from these two young victims over the last two years is truly inspiring.’\\n\\nIn August, William Zulock, 34, pleaded guilty to aggravated sodomy, child molestation, incest, and two counts of sexual exploitation of children.\\n\\nZachary Zulock, 36, entered into his own guilty plea on October 21 for aggravated sodomy, child molestation, and sexual exploitation of children. Zachary had a bench trial for the two incest counts and was found guilty by Judge Jeffrey L. Foster.\\n\\nFollowing arguments from the prosecution and the defense, Foster adhered to the state’s recommendation and sentenced both men to 100 years behind bars without the possibility of parole, followed by probation for life.\\n\\nBut due to the seriousness of their offense, neither of them will be eligible for parole until the entire 100 years is up, ensuring they’ll die in prison.\\n\\nIn their initial search of Zulocks’ posh home in the Atlanta suburbs, police reviewed two weeks worth of footage from interior surveillance cameras, which showed the men sexually abusing the children in several different parts of the house.\\n\\nThe case against the couple began on July 22, 2022, when the Walton County Sheriff’s Office got a tip from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation’s Child Exploitation and Computer Crimes unit.\\n\\nInvestigators received an alert from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children about suspected child sexual abuse material (CSAM) uploaded to a Google account with a Walton County IP address.\\n\\nAfter obtaining a search warrant, investigators raided the Zulocks’ home and discovered over seven terabytes of digital evidence, home surveillance footage, and cell phone data that had contained graphic images, videos and text messages discussing the abuse.\\n\\nIn subsequent interviews, both men admitted they had spent years sexually abusing their sons, whom they had adopted in 2018 from a now defunct Christian agency.\\n\\nThis involved them sodomizing the boys and forcing them to perform oral sex on them, they told police.\\n\\nZachary Zulock and William Zulock were once the darlings of the LGBTQ scene in Georgia\\n\\nThe investigation into the Zulocks also revealed they were communicating with two other pedophiles – Hunter Lawless and Luis Vizcarro-Sanchez – about the abuse of their boys.\\n\\nArrest documents said Zachary Zulock messaged Lawless on Snapchat that he was going to ‘f**k his son’ and to ‘stand by.’ Lawless also told police the Zulocks offered their boys up to him ‘multiple times.’\\n\\nLawless was arrested after downloading a large amount of child porn that was traced by police to his Gmail address.\\n\\nLawless admitted he received child sex abuse material from Zachary and was later sentenced to 20 years in prison, with the first 12 to be served in prison.\\n\\nIncriminating messages from Zachary were also Vizcarro-Sanchez’s phone. He pleaded guilty to pandering for a person under 18.\\n\\nAfter also pleading guilty to the unrelated crime of stealing computers from his workplace, Vizcarro-Sanchez was sentenced to 60 years, the first 15 of which will be served in prison.\\n\\nThe couple was able to adopt their two sons, who are 12 and 10 years old now, despite Zachary having been accused of raping another boy in 2011. That allegation was reported to police but never investigated by prosecutors thoroughly enough to warrant charges.\\n\\nZachary Zulock and William Zulock were raising their sons in an affluent Atlanta suburb for the roughly three years they had custody of them.\\n\\nPictured: The Zulocks’ home in Georgia, which they were able to have built from scratch\\n\\nZachary (right) worked for a local bank branch while William worked for a local government customer service center, but somehow the couple were raking in $7,500-a-week\\n\\nZachary worked for a local bank branch while William worked for a local government customer service center, but somehow the couple were raking in $7,500-a-week.\\n\\nThey were able to build their dream home in an area where similar properties sell for $900,000.\\n\\nBehind their façade of a happy family living in a beautiful home was the reality that they were regularly raping their children.\\n\\nZachary and William adopted the boys from foster care. The boys, then five and three, had been removed from their heroin-addicted parents and placed in foster care.\\n\\nThe pair said the abuse and the filming of that abuse occurred between 2019 and 2021.\\n\\nIn 2021, just a year before they were arrested on heinous sexual abuse allegations, the pair made inquiries about adopting a two-year-old girl.\\n\\nThe adoption agency they used was All Gods Children Inc, a now defunct special needs agency in Georgia.

has said it has fired a subcontractor working on the construction of its electric vehicle factory in Brazil after local labour officials said they had rescued 163 workers from “slavery”-like conditions.\\n\\nBYD, the Warren Buffett-backed rival to Tesla that is China’s biggest EV group, is revamping an old Ford factory in north-eastern Bahia state as part of rapid global expansion plans.\\n\\nAccording to Brazilian officials, workers with Jinjiang Construction, BYD’s Chinese subcontractor, faced “extremely degrading” conditions at their on-site dormitories, including overcrowding, beds without mattresses and inadequate provision of bathrooms.\\n\\nBrazilian officials also alleged that unsafe working conditions and long hours had resulted in accidents at the site. They claimed to have found evidence of forced labour, with workers’ passports confiscated and 60 per cent of their wages withheld.\\n\\nBYD said it had terminated a contract with Jinjiang, while a spokesperson for the carmaker shared the subcontractor’s denials of any wrongdoing on social media.\\n\\nThe inspections at the plant in Camaçari were carried out by a multi-agency task force involving the labour ministry, the public labour prosecution office, the federal public defender and police forces.\\n\\nLiane Durão, a labour inspector, said Jinjiang appeared to have brought construction workers into Brazil in an irregular manner by saying they were hired to provide specialised technical assistance.\\n\\n“As we discovered a very serious situation, we are still continuing the investigation into the other contractors,” she added.\\n\\nBYD’s local Brazilian office said the company had “zero tolerance for any disrespect of Brazilian law and human dignity”.\\n\\n“Consequently, the company has decided to immediately terminate its contract with the contractor for a portion of the construction work and is evaluating other appropriate measures,” BYD added. Other subcontractors were continuing work on the site.\\n\\nIn a Chinese-language statement on social media platform Weibo, Jinjiang said claims that its employees were “enslaved” or “rescued” were “completely inconsistent with the facts”.\\n\\nJinjiang, which is based in Sichuan, south-west China, added that cultural differences, translation and interpretation errors had led to “inaccuracies” in the official Brazilian statements.\\n\\nLi Yunfei, BYD’s public relations head, shared the post and said “certain foreign forces” had smeared Chinese brands and slandered China to “undermine the China-Brazil friendship”.\\n\\nBYD did not respond to further questions about the alleged worker abuse.\\n\\nChinese high-tech manufacturers are increasingly building factories on foreign soil. HSBC estimates annual overseas EV sales by Chinese companies will grow to 4mn by 2030 from 424,000 in 2023, with about half of those cars expected to be produced outside China.\\n\\nRecommended\\n\\nBYD is the key driver for that growth. Its billionaire founder Wang Chuanfu wants overseas sales to reach 1mn as early as 2025. Factories are also being built in Turkey, Hungary and Thailand.\\n\\nThe carmaker has been operating in Brazil for about a decade and produces bus chassis, batteries and solar panels there.\\n\\nThe company confirmed plans to begin making EVs in Latin America’s largest economy following a meeting between Wang and President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in China last year.\\n\\nThe investment was trumpeted by the leftwing Lula administration as an early success of its ambition for a “green” revival of the country’s industry.\\n\\nAdditional reporting by Nian Liu in Beijing"}, "meta": {},

evidence that could aid in ongoing plea discussions.\\n\\nJeffrey Brent Thomas, 46, was indicted in the Eastern District of Oklahoma in 2021 with three counts of aggravated sexual abuse in Indian Country and abusive sexual contact in Indian Country.\\n\\nRecords show two counts of felony lewd molestation filed against Thomas in Pittsburg County District Court remain active against as well as three counts of felony child sexual abuse in Choctaw Nation District Court.\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThomas was recently sentenced in February to serve 46 months in a federal prison for aggravated assault of a federal officer with a deadly and dangerous weapon in connection to his arrest for the current charges in Tulsa County.\\n\\nA trial set to begin on Nov. 5 was continued to February 2025 after attorneys for Thomas said they continue to seek additional materials from prosecutors and that the defense has recently retained an expert and are awaiting a report.\\n\\nAttorneys for Thomas seek a continuance of the February 2025 trial date due to a \"significant amount of discovery material\" has been produced in the case.\\n\\n\"Moreover, defense counsel has retained an expert, who has been provided with case materials and from whom counsel awaits a report of the expert's evaluation,\" the motion to continue states. \"This report is expected

discussions with prosecutors regarding a non-trial resolution of the case.\\n\\n\"Of course, this negotiation is complicated by the tremendous minimum length of incarceration to which defendant is exposed by the current charges, including a likely guideline range that will recommend a life sentence, if convicted on all counts,\" the motion states.\\n\\nA ruling on the motion to continue was not available as of press time.\\n\\nInvestigators began their investigation in January 2021 after the child told her mother about Thomas touching her while he was driving the child to a residence, the affidavit states.\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAccording to the affidavit, the child told investigators she was scared that Thomas would attempt to harm the child by coming forward to her mother.\\n\\nDuring a forensic interview with investigators at PC-CARE, the child said Thomas began touching her sometime in January 2020 and would do it when her mother was not home or was asleep, the affidavit states.\\n\\nThe child's mother told investigators that she did confront Thomas after being told about what was happening and that Thomas never denied the incident during the confrontation, the affidavit states.\\n\\nAccording to the affidavit, after Thomas was taken into custody on a misdemeanor warrant, investigators spoke with the man regarding the allegation made by the eight-year-old child.\\n\\nThomas told investigators that he and the child \"had a great relationship\" and he \"couldn't understand why anyone would make the allegations against him\" and that he \"has never done anything that could be misconstrued as inappropriate,\" the report states."}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.713430Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-13T15:20:34.942887Z",

Alliance for a Safe Community to check rising incidents of missing children and child sex abuse.\\n\\nIts chairman, Tan Sri Lee Lam Thye, said the urgency to address this issue cannot be overstated, as statistics show that many missing children are at risk of falling victim to exploitation, including human trafficking and sexual abuse.\\n\\n“These alarming trends represent a grave threat to the safety and well-being of our children - the most vulnerable members of our society. Every child deserves to live free from fear, harm and exploitation.\\n\\n“Every missing child is a tragedy that leaves families devastated and communities shaken. Child sex abuse, whether committed by strangers or individuals known to the child, is a heinous crime with long-lasting psychological and physical effects,“ he said in a statement here today.\\n\\nLee said it is essential to strengthen cybersecurity measures to detect and shut down illicit activities, as many predators operate online. Besides, parents must also be educated on how to monitor their children’s online activities effectively.\\n\\nHe also called for comprehensive sex education, with schools implementing age-appropriate sex education programmes that teach children about personal boundaries, recognising inappropriate behaviour and reporting abuse without fear.\\n\\nAll institutions including schools, religious organisations and recreational centres must adopt mandatory reporting protocols for suspected child abuse, he said. Hotlines and digital platforms for anonymous reporting should be widely promoted, while laws protecting children must be robust and rigorously enforced.\\n\\n“Stiffer penalties should be imposed on perpetrators of child sex abuse and human trafficking. Additionally, law enforcement agencies need enhanced tools and training to locate missing children swiftly and handle abuse cases with sensitivity,“ he said.\\n\\nLee said that public awareness of these issues needs to be enhanced, with parents, guardians and caregivers being educated about the risks that children face and equipped with knowledge to identify signs of grooming or abuse.\\n\\nCommunity participation at all levels of society, such as neighbourhood watch programmes, community patrols and volunteer initiatives, should also be fostered, as they can act as a first line of defence in safeguarding children.\\n\\nLee also called for adequate funding for shelter homes, counselling services and rehabilitation programmes for victims of such incidents.\\n\\n“We urge all stakeholders - parents, educators, policymakers law enforcement, and civil society - to come together in creating a safer environment for our children. We must be relentless in our efforts to protect the innocence and dignity of our children, for in doing so, we safeguard the future of our nation,“ he said."}, "meta": {}, "created_at":

export comprising abhorrent phenomena contrary to s233(1)(c) Customs Act 1901 and prohibited import comprising abhorrent phenomena contrary to s233(1)(b) Customs Act 1901) and was fined $15,000.\\n\\nABF Acting Inspector David Gordon said the ABF was often the first line of defence at international airports when it came to the detection of child abuse material, and professionally trained officers remained alert to its importation.\\n\\n“Possessing and sharing child abuse and bestiality images is by no means a victimless crime and we are determined to protect the Australian community from its impacts,” Acting Inspector Gordon said.\\n\\n“We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners, including WA Police, to ensure those who commit these offences are accountable before the courts.”"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.713480Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-12T13:31:56.754446Z", "inner_id": 125, "total_annotations": 2,

"Sometimes when the pain hits, Agnes* has to pause for several seconds to ride out the excruciating wave. It feels like someone has tied a rope to her insides and is pulling and twisting it, the 27-year-old Nigerian domestic worker says, making it hard to bend or stand up straight.\\n\\nAgnes’s ordeal started in March in the Iraqi city of Basra when her boss raped her at gunpoint. She fell pregnant, and the man then forced her to undergo a painful abortion. It was so difficult, Agnes said, that she could not sit for three days. Since then, the severe abdominal pains won’t go away, and there’s no one to take her to a hospital.\\n\\n“I just want to go home and treat myself, but I can’t do that,” Agnes said on a phone call from Basra, where she is holed up in a hostel belonging to the recruiting firm that hired her from Nigeria last year. “The man has refused to pay my salary. I don’t know if I am pregnant, but I have not seen my menstruation since then. I just want to go home and check myself and see what’s happening inside me,” she added, her voice breaking.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAl Jazeera is not mentioning Agnes’s real name because she fears reprisals from the staff of the so-called recruiting agency. She is one of hundreds, if not thousands, of people who are caught in a transnational labour network that often sees women from Nigeria and other African countries deceived into domestic servitude in Iraqi cities, activists said.\\n\\nIn Nigeria, the women are hired by a ring of local “agents” who sell them a dream of good pay and good conditions abroad. They get the women to agree, process visas and send them off to recruitment firms in Iraq for a commission of about $500 per woman, according to activists familiar with the system.\\n\\nOnce there, the Iraqi firms ask the women, called “shagalas” (meaning “house worker” in Arabic), to sign two-year contracts and assign them to families or labour-intensive institutions like spas, where they are often expected to work more than 20 hours a day for monthly pay of $200 to $250. In many homes, the women are subject to inhumane treatment: They go days without food, are beaten and are not provided living quarters.\\n\\nSome, like Agnes, also face sexual abuse and rape. Several women told Al Jazeera stories of victims who had faced so much abuse and torture that they ended up dead although these cases have not been independently confirmed.\\n\\n“It’s a form of modern slavery,” said Damilola Adekola, co-founder of Hopes Haven Foundation, a Nigerian NGO that helps track women in Iraq and other Middle Eastern countries where abuse of African domestic workers is rife. “These Iraqi agents and the families [the women work for] often tell them, ‘We’ve bought you, so you have to work.’ The contracts they sign go against any type of international law because there’s no medical care and they have to work obscene hours.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThese women often lack knowledge of what a normal workplace should be like because the Nigerian recruiters target women from rural communities who are usually uninformed about the dangers, Adekola added. Although some have diplomas, they often don’t know about the realities of post-war Iraq or that Baghdad is not a country. “Once they hear they can get on an airplane, they just jump at the opportunity,” he said.\\n\\nA chance to ‘hustle’ abroad goes badly\\n\\nA native of Nigeria’s Ekiti, a small state northeast of the commercial capital, Lagos, Agnes was working as a domestic worker at home when she heard of an opportunity that could take her abroad.\\n\\nShe paid 100,000 naira ($64) to a local recruiting agent, a family friend whom she trusted, believing that she would be able to make much more money to send home to her ailing mother and nine-year-old son.\\n\\nSoaring inflation in Nigeria has crippled the naira since 2019. The result has been that Nigerians, young and old, are leaving the country to seek better opportunities. According to an Afrobarometer report this month, more than half of the 200 million population indicated they want to leave the country due to economic hardship with most looking at Europe, North America and the Middle East.\\n\\nFor Agnes, domestic work anywhere else and with the promise of pay that was three times what she normally earned, was an answered prayer. She left for Basra from Lagos airport in September 2023 and arrived at the Iraqi recruitment firm she had been “sold” to after a day’s journey.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nOnce in Iraq, Agnes’s dreams of a comfortable life abroad turned into a nightmare. Her first shock was at the recruitment firm in Iraq. The firm assigned her a first home to work at, but Agnes was badly treated. She wasn’t given food regularly although her boss would force her to work all day, and her phone was seized, she said. When she complained and refused to work, the Iraqi man returned her to the agents, demanding a refund. Angered that she’d caused a loss, two employers from the firm descended on Agnes, she said, hitting her, punching her and smashing her mobile.\\n\\n“I had to use a bandage on my eye for three days,” Agnes said. In a photo taken days after the beating and seen by Al Jazeera, Agnes’s right cheek is red and swollen. The firm then forced her to go to a second home, which is where she said the rape took place.\\n\\nNow, Agnes is back in the firm’s hostel, penniless. After the pains in her abdomen rendered her unable to work, she said the boss who raped her abandoned her there and refused to pay six months of her salary.\\n\\n“If I knew what this country is like, I wouldn’t have come here. If I knew it’s not safe and there is no respect for life, I wouldn’t have come. I just thought I could also come here and hustle. Please help me get out of here,” she pleaded.\\n\\nAlthough she has a place to sleep and she, as well as dozens of women at the hostel, get some noodles and rice daily to cook, Agnes is fearful. The agency has refused to send her back to Nigeria, insisting that she has one more year to work on her contract, despite her debilitating pain.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAgnes said she tries not to aggravate staff of the firm to avoid beatings. Several women there have either been beaten or have been locked up for days without food because their bosses complained of their conduct, she said. Al Jazeera is not revealing the name of the company in order to protect the women, but we did seek official responses regarding the firm from the Iraqi Ministry of Interior, which is in charge of Iraq’s police. We have not yet received a response.\\n\\nTrafficking of Africans rife in Middle East\\n\\nDespite several laws against labour trafficking, the practice is rife in post-war Iraq. The country is both a source and destination country for trafficked victims with an estimated 221,000 people currently in slavery-like conditions, according to a November report from the International Organization of Migration (IOM). Most documented victims are from Iran and Indonesia.\\n\\nThe experiences of African female domestic workers in Iraq are largely undocumented, but the challenges they face have been going on for years. Black people have historically been seen as slaves in the country and still face discrimination today.\\n\\nIn 2011, news reports documented how dozens of Ugandan women were tricked by local agents into believing they would be working on United States army bases when the country was under American occupation after the fall of Saddam Hussein’s government. Instead, the women were “sold” to Iraqi firms for about $3,500 and forced to work in dire conditions. Eventually, some escaped with the help of US army staff, but others were never accounted for.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nSimilar cases of exploitation are being reported across the Middle East, where hundreds of thousands of migrant workers from African and Asian countries are at higher risk of trafficking, according to the IOM.\\n\\nUnder the “kafala” system, which is legal in countries like Lebanon, employers pay for the documentation and travel costs of the foreign workers and use that as leverage to abuse them by confiscating their passports or seizing their pay, reports have shown. The system doesn’t give the worker the right to seek out another employer but does allow employers to transfer contracts to others. Recruitment agencies often use the legal system to employ many workers and then auction the contracts online for huge amounts of money.\\n\\nIt’s unclear to what extent Iraqi authorities investigate agents hiring and “selling” African workers or the individuals who maltreat these women. Authorities however appear to be investigating one case that has garnered widespread attention on Nigerian social media.\\n\\nEniola, 28, had, like her counterparts, jumped at the opportunity to earn more money abroad as a domestic worker and arrived in Baghdad in February 2023. However, her boss forced her to work most of the day and allowed her only three to four hours of sleep. When she complained, the woman routinely tortured her with tasers or hit her with an iron rod. She doused her with hot tea or water on several occasions too.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIn videos Eniola sent to Al Jazeera, her fingers, which appear to be broken, are bandaged, and scars from burns and wounds dot her body. She found the courage to finally escape in August after more than a year of abuse. Al Jazeera is only using Eniola’s first name to protect her identity.\\n\\n“She had just beat me when she put some water on the fire and told me to enter the bathroom,” Eniola told Al Jazeera. She feared her boss wanted to pour hot water on her, so she fled. “I don’t know where I got the courage, but I ran outside.”\\n\\nBleeding, Eniola ran to groups of locals who, shocked by her wounds, helped her get to a police station where she handed herself in. She was never paid by her boss.\\n\\nIn a statement, Iraq’s interior ministry told Al Jazeera it was not aware of the two women’s cases, but vowed to investigate the matter.\\n\\nAn officer at the country’s Directorate for Residence Affairs in charge of residency violations, and where Eniola has been transferred, told Al Jazeera the abusive boss had been “invited by government agencies for questioning and was bieng investigated”.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, Eniola confirmed she was arraigned in court alongside her former boss, and a years’ worth of salary was handed to her. Eniola, only willing to go home, said she declined to press charges against the Iraqi woman. Authorities plan to force the boss to pay for her ticket home, she said, but it’s unclear when that will happen.\\n\\nThere are several other Nigerian women in detention for various offences: fighting with their bosses, overstaying their residence permits or “taking salaries and running away,” said the Iraqi official, who is not authorised to speak to the press.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nNigerian domestic workers Al Jazeera spoke to however say their Iraqi bosses have been known to take advantage of language barriers and some wrongfully accuse the women of crimes.\\n\\nNigeria fails to act quickly, activists say\\n\\nActivists blamed Nigerian authorities for failing to regulate the industry and allowing groups of women to head to Middle Eastern countries for domestic work without proper documentation or a system to track them. Some reports also accuse staff of the Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS) of taking bribes from local agents and turning a blind eye at airports to clear cases of exploitation.\\n\\nAl Jazeera put these allegations to the NIS via email. In a statement, the NIS said it would respond to the accusations but did not reply in time for publication.\\n\\n“Immigration is never a crime, and we are not saying people should not find work abroad, but there should be a government system where these women are registered and taxed, even if it’s a small token,” Adekola of the Hopes Haven Foundation said. The organisation helped alert authorities to Eniola’s and Agnes’s cases.\\n\\n“With that, the government can monitor the women’s information and work situation. If these employers torturing them know that the ladies are being monitored by their government, they’ll not try what they’re doing to them.”\\n\\nOfficials at the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), the Nigerian anti-trafficking agency, first sounded the alarm about the exploitative recruitment drives to Iraq in May 2023.\\n\\nSome rogue agents who take part in recruiting and “selling” the women are known by NAPTIP and are under investigation, an official who had not been authorised to speak to the media and who we are therefore not naming, told Al Jazeera.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAgnes’s and Eniola’s cases are being investigated, the official said but did not give a timeline as to when the women might be repatriated. Nigeria does not have an embassy in Iraq, and the official said the agency was liaising with the Nigerian consulate in Jordan.\\n\\nIn Basra, Agnes is still holed up in her recruitment agency’s hostel, hoping for a way out. She can hardly stand up from her bed, she said. This week, some women arrived freshly from Nigeria and Uganda, and have been sent to their assigned homes to work, she said. The women, Agnes added, were fearful after seeing her condition but were forced to go.\\n\\n“I just want to go home because I’m not OK,” she said. “I’m barely alive. Please help me get out. I’m too young to die here.”\\n\\n*Name changed to protect anonymity\\n\\nEMEA Tribune is not involved in this news article, it is taken from our partners and or from the News Agencies.

sharp rise in alleged human slavery and trafficking offences this year.\\n\\nAs the year comes to a close, the agency said it had charged 790 people with 1848 offences across the country in 2024.\\n\\nShockingly, the AFP said reports of human slavery reached an all-time high during the year with a 12 per cent increase in 2023-24 compared with the previous year.\\n\\nThe agency received 382 reports of human slavery and trafficking including forced marriage, forced labour, sexual exploitation, domestic slavery and debt bondage.\\n\\nThere was also one report of organ trafficking in 2023-24.\\n\\nIn July, a Sydney man was arrested who police allege was the mastermind of an international criminal syndicate which recruited Indonesian-based victims to be trafficked to Australia.\\n\\nCamera Icon The criminal syndicate is alleged to have trafficked a 17-year-old from Indonesia to Sydney for sex work. Supplied/AFP. Credit: News Corp Australia\\n\\nIt has been alleged that he was involved in transporting a 17-year-old from Indonesia to Sydney for sex work.\\n\\nHuman slavery and trafficking is often well hidden but authorities hope that by shining a light on the unseen pandemic, they will helpto eradicate it.\\n\\nAccording to a UN report, one in three victims of trafficking are children.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the AFP revealed it stopped 33.7 tonnes of drugs and seized $110m in assets being imported into Australia in 2024.\\n\\nThat included Operation Kraken - one of the federal police force’s most significant operations which saw it crack down on the Ghost encrypted app, which it alleges was built exclusively for the criminal underworld.\\n\\nCamera Icon Jay Je-Yoon Jung was arrested at his Sydney home. AFP. Credit: Supplied\\n\\nThe AFP arrested Sydney man Jay Je Yoon Jung, who is alleged to have been the mastermind behind the encrypted app .\\n\\nThe 32-year-old was arrested at his Narwee home and charged with five offences including supporting a criminal group and dealing with the proceeds of crime. He remains before the courts.\\n\\nOperation Kraken resulted in 52 people being charged and 230kg of drugs being seized.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Joint Counter Terrorism Teams - which comprises the AFP, state police and other federal agencies - charged 17 people during counter-terrorism operations.\\n\\nOf those 17 charged, 12 were aged 17 or younger.\\n\\nCamera Icon Part of an alleged 500kg cocaine importation stopped by the AFP. Supplied/AFP Credit: News Corp Australia\\n\\nThe AFP also charged 1062 people with over 1200 offences at Australian airports.\\n\\nAFP officers patrol nine major airports across the country - including Sydney airport.\\n\\nThe offences range from assault, offensive behaviour and money laundering.\\n\\nAFP assistant commander Bill Polychronopoulos said the force wouldn’t sleep over the holidays and into the new year.\\n\\n“Our message to criminals is that the AFP won’t be slowing down over the holidays and our work is never done,” Assistant Commander Polychronopoulos said.\\n\\n“The AFP doesn’t take a holiday and will continue to work collectively alongside our domestic and international law enforcement partners to combat corruption and investigate crime – both onshore and

December 10, 2024, marking the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948. This year’s slogan, “Our rights, our future, right now,” highlighted the universal and immediate relevance of human rights in addressing global and local challenges. For Nepal, this day carried particular significance as it coincided with the conclusion of the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence (GBV) campaign, which spotlighted the urgency of addressing systemic violence and exploitation.\\n\\nNepal’s human rights landscape is complex, shaped by intersecting challenges of modern slavery, gender-based violence, and digital exploitation, all of which disproportionately affect marginalized groups.\\n\\nWhile the country has established robust legal frameworks and institutions, including the National Human Rights Commission of Nepal (NHRCN), barriers such as weak enforcement, cultural resistance, and systemic inequality continue to undermine progress. Understanding these dynamics is critical to advancing human rights in Nepal, ensuring that legal and institutional commitments translate into tangible outcomes for the most vulnerable.\\n\\nModern Slavery: A Persistent Global and Local Issue\\n\\nModern slavery remains one of the gravest human rights violations, affecting more than 50 million people globally, including 28 million in forced labor and 22 million in forced marriages. Women and girls constitute 70% of victims, enduring forced sexual exploitation, domestic servitude, and labor in exploitative industries.\\n\\nAsia is home to over 30 million enslaved individuals, with South Asia accounting for approximately 16 million victims. In Nepal, where over 35,000 women and girls are trafficked annually, the problem is exacerbated by economic disparities, systemic poverty, and harmful cultural practices. Many of these victims are lured into Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, where they face exploitative conditions under the kafala system, which ties workers to their employers and strips them of freedom and rights.\\n\\nDespite constitutional protections, such as those enshrined in the 2015 Constitution, and anti-trafficking laws, Nepal struggles to enforce these safeguards effectively. Gaps in implementation allow traffickers to exploit vulnerable populations with impunity, perpetuating cycles of exploitation. Institutions like the NHRCN play an important role in addressing these issues, investigating human rights violations, and recommending legal or departmental action against perpetrators. However, the NHRCN’s inability to compel the government to act on its recommendations often limits its effectiveness, leaving critical human rights violations unaddressed.\\n\\nRelated story The awakening of LGBTIs\\n\\nDigital Exploitation: The Role of Social Media in Trafficking\\n\\nSocial media platforms have become powerful tools for traffickers, enabling them to recruit, deceive, and control victims with unprecedented efficiency. Platforms like TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp among others are used to lure victims under the guise of legitimate job opportunities or relationships. Once recruited, victims are often isolated and monitored using encrypted communication platforms, making intervention difficult.\\n\\nIn a prominent 2021 case, traffickers used TikTok to lure Bangladeshi women into India with promises of employment, only to force them into sexual exploitation. Investigations into GCC countries revealed that traffickers exploited Instagram’s algorithm to promote hashtags advertising domestic workers, normalizing the commodification of human labor.\\n\\nNepal is no stranger to these patterns. Social media is frequently used to target young women from rural areas, offering false promises of better lives abroad. In response, the Government of Nepal introduced the 2023 Directives for Managing Social Networks, under the Electronic Transaction Act (2008), to hold platforms accountable for misuse. While these directives are a step forward, they are limited in scope and cannot address the systemic vulnerabilities that traffickers exploit.\\n\\nGender-Based Violence and Inequality\\n\\nModern slavery in Nepal is closely tied to gender-based violence (GBV) and deeply entrenched inequalities. Practices such as Chhaupadi (the isolation of menstruating women), dowry violence, and child marriage persist, despite legal prohibitions. These practices disproportionately affect women, Dalits, and LGBTQIA+ individuals, leaving them economically dependent and vulnerable to exploitation.\\n\\nDuring the 16 Days of Activism Against GBV, activists highlighted how these cultural norms perpetuate cycles of abuse and exploitation. For example, Chhaupadi forces women into unhygienic and unsafe conditions, increasing their vulnerability to violence and trafficking. Similarly, dowry practices fuel economic exclusion and domestic abuse, while early marriage deprives girls of education and opportunities, pushing them into exploitative labor markets.\\n\\nThe NHRCN has sought to address these challenges through awareness campaigns, community outreach, and collaboration with civil society organizations. Its motto, “Human rights for all, at every household: basis of peace and development,” reflects its commitment to fostering a culture of human rights at all levels of society. However, without enforcement powers or the government’s commitment to implementing its recommendations, these efforts often fail to bring systemic change.\\n\\nChallenges to Human Rights Implementation: A Global Perspective\\n\\nNepal’s human rights struggles reflect broader global challenges. The international human rights system is vast, comprising numerous UN instruments, special mechanisms, committees, and evaluation processes. While these frameworks aim to protect and promote rights, their sheer volume creates barriers to understanding and implementation. It is difficult to count the number of instruments or mechanisms, let alone expect the general public to navigate them. Even experts struggle to maintain specialized knowledge of this complex system.\\n\\nThis overabundance has led to a supply-side focus—creating norms, processes, and structures—without adequate attention to the demand side, such as public accessibility and practical implementation. For ordinary people, understanding what constitutes human rights or how to seek remedies remains a significant challenge. In Nepal, this disconnect is evident in the gap between legal frameworks and their enforcement, which leaves marginalized communities without effective protection.\\n\\nThe NHRCN: A Toothless Tiger or a Vital Institution?\\n\\nEstablished in 2000 and elevated to a constitutional body in 2007, the National Human Rights Commission of Nepal (NHRCN) is tasked with ensuring the respect, promotion, and protection of human rights. The NHRCN adheres to the Paris Principles, which guarantee its independence and broad mandate. It has the authority to investigate violations, recommend reforms to constitutional safeguards, and propose legal or departmental action against perpetrators.\\n\\nDespite these powers, the NHRCN’s non-binding recommendations often fail to drive government action. Critics argue that this limitation reduces the NHRCN to a symbolic entity, unable to deliver substantive change. However, its role in raising awareness, fostering collaboration with civil society, and monitoring human rights violations remains indispensable. Strengthening its enforcement powers could transform it into an effective agent of accountability and reform.\\n\\nReflections on Human Rights Day 2024\\n\\nThe theme “Our rights, our future, right now” reminds us that human rights must be actionable, relevant, and accessible. For Nepal, the fight against modern slavery, GBV, and digital exploitation requires bold reforms and sustained efforts. Institutions like the NHRCN must be empowered with enforcement capabilities to ensure that their recommendations lead to meaningful change.\\n\\nPublic awareness campaigns must bridge the gap between legal frameworks and everyday realities, enabling marginalized communities to understand and assert their rights. Legislative reforms targeting harmful practices like Chhaupadi and dowry violence must be matched by strong enforcement mechanisms. Additionally, collaboration with social media platforms is essential to prevent digital exploitation, while international partnerships must address the transnational nature of trafficking.\\n\\nAs Nepal reflects on its human rights journey, it must prioritize practical solutions that empower vulnerable populations and ensure justice for all. Human Rights Day 2024 is not just a commemoration; it is a call to action—a reminder that the principles of dignity, equality, and freedom must be upheld in every household and community.\\n\\nBy addressing systemic inequalities and strengthening its institutions, Nepal can transform its human rights commitments into realities, building a future where rights are not just aspirations but lived experiences for all."}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.713545Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-14T14:32:11.800767Z", "inner_id": 129, "total_annotations": 2, "cancelled_annotations": 0,

"6770bbd76933901ae1d3cab8"}, "text": "A complaint filed in U.S. District Court this week named the Virgin Islands government, Education and Human Services departments and staff members in an expansive civil suit over failures to address allegations against Alfredo Bruce Smith, the former hall monitor and track coach who terrorized Charlotte Amalie High School students for one-and-a-half decades.\\n\\nThe suit was filed anonymously by a survivor of Smith’s abuses, identified in the complaint as John Doe. In addition to government departments, the suit specifically names CAHS Principal Alcede Edwards, whom the complaint describes as “a school official with a duty to report alleged abuse” and someone with actual knowledge of Smith’s crimes, and teacher Camelia Febres, described as “someone who knew Plaintiff feared being forced into a room” with Smith during a March 2019 school trip to Puerto Rico.\\n\\nAlso named are 20 fictitious defendants, or “as-yet unidentified school officials, board members, teachers, coaches, social workers, administrators, or other employees or agents of the GVI, VIDE, BOE, and/or VIDHS” who knew or should have known about Smith’s years of abuses or who otherwise failed to safeguard students.\\n\\n“Fictitious pleading is required here because the Defendants and others have made efforts to conceal the identities” of those employees and officials, wrote attorney Daniel Cevallos of the New York-based law firm Cevallos and Wong.\\n\\nCollectively, all of the defendants are accused of depriving the plaintiff of their bodily integrity, violating the 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause; failure to train staff; state-created danger; three counts of conspiracy; violating the Trafficking Victims Protection Act; civil conspiracy; civil assault; civil battery; and negligence.\\n\\nThe Virgin Islands government, Board of Education and Education and Human Services departments are accused of quid pro quo harassment, creating a hostile environment, deliberate indifference, failure to train, and retaliation.\\n\\nSmith — who is also a defendant in the lawsuit — was sentenced to 35 years in federal prison last April after pleading guilty to 20 charges that included: aggravated second-degree rape; first-degree unlawful sexual contact; coercion and enticement; and production of child pornography.\\n\\nEven after Smith’s sentencing, questions about how his abuses were able to continue for so long remained. A long-awaited report by the Praed Foundation, released publicly in September, offered some insight into the barriers education workers face in reporting suspected abuse. Some respondents stated concerns about confidentiality and fears of retaliation. Others said they didn’t feel qualified to identify instances of abuse.\\n\\nThe report did not mention — and was not meant to identify — Education and other officials who knew about Smith’s crimes but failed to act as the V.I. Code requires them to.\\n\\nThis month, The Source confirmed that two principals and one assistant principal had been placed on leave amid an Education Department investigation. The department has yet to offer an official statement regarding that investigation.\\n\\nThe lawsuit comes on the heels of a recently enacted law that eliminated the statute of limitations on civil actions brought after cases of sexual assault.\\n\\nThat legislation was special ordered during the 35th Legislature’s Nov. 20 session by Sen. Marise James, who chairs the Senate Education and Workforce Development Committee. Lt. Gov. Tregenza Roach, as acting governor, signed the measure into law earlier this month. Speaking to The Source at the time, Roach said the bill “only addresses civil actions. It basically provides that there is no limitation and that those suits can be brought at any time.”\\n\\n“Similarly,” he said,” there is no statute of limitations with regard to the criminal law and such offenses.”\\n\\nAttorneys for the plaintiff highlighted the extension in the complaint, noting that the “statute also applies retroactively, allowing previously barred cases to proceed.”"},

That wasn’t the case in the past. 85,000 Women Were Killed By Men in 2023–Report From the United Nations.\\n\\nAuthor’s Notes\\n\\nThe US crime data below is from the National Crime Victimization Survey, Bureau Of Justice Statistics of the US Department of Justice. I use survey data and not crimes reported to law enforcement via the FBI because of the lack of reporting of interpersonal crimes.\\n\\nPortions of this article use verified Open AI data.\\n\\nArticle\\n\\nListen to this article on Spotify or view it via YouTube.\\n\\nOn my first domestic violence call as a police officer, we encountered a woman beaten by her husband with a frying pan. Considering I had never witnessed an act of domestic violence before this, it was a shocking event that troubled me deeply.\\n\\nIt was my introduction to violence against women and interpersonal violence. A series of recent data releases addressing violence against women led to this article.\\n\\nRates of Violence For Males Exceeded That Of Females Until They Didn’t\\n\\nThere was a time before 2015 when the rate of violent crimes for males typically exceeded that for females. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), the rate of violent crime victimization for females exceeded that of males in 2015.\\n\\nThis marked a significant shift, as males historically experienced higher rates of violent crime. The Bureau of Justice Statistics noted it in their yearly report.\\n\\nA review of annual reports from the Bureau of Justice Statistics indicates that the largest increase in female victimization during that period happened in 2015 with females generally leading for overall violence or serious violence for 2015-2017.\\n\\nLatest Data From Criminal Victimization From The Bureau Of Justice Statistics\\n\\nThe data below shows that females have higher rates of criminal victimization than males for total violent crimes and violent crimes excluding simple assaults (known as serious violent crimes) in 2023. Male and female violent victimization was essentially the same for all violent crimes in 2022.\\n\\nIntimate Partner Violence (IPV): Women are disproportionately victims of intimate partner violence, which includes physical assault, rape, and stalking by current or former partners. The NCVS consistently reports higher rates of IPV for females compared to males.\\n\\nAcquaintance Perpetrators: Women are more likely than men to be victimized by someone they know, such as a family member, friend, or acquaintance. In contrast, men are more often victimized by strangers​\\n\\nSexual Violence: The majority of sexual violence victims are women, and these crimes are predominantly committed by known individuals, further highlighting the interpersonal nature of violence against females.​\\n\\nWhile not all violent crimes against females are interpersonal, a significant portion of victimization stems from relational dynamics. This contrasts with violent crime against males, which is more likely to involve strangers and occur in public settings.\\n\\nBlack Women And Girls-Office Of Justice Programs\\n\\nBlack women and girls are disproportionately affected by violence, trafficking, and systemic neglect, leading to high rates of their disappearance, and placing them at greater risk for homicide. Although they make up a significant portion of missing person cases in the U.S., their stories often go underreported and unnoticed by national media and law enforcement. According to the National Crime Information Center, in 2022, of the 271,493 girls and women reported missing, 97,924, or over 36 percent, were Black, despite the fact that Black women and girls comprised only 14 percent of the U.S. female population at the time.\\n\\n85,000 Women Were Killed By Men in 2023–Report From The United Nations\\n\\nA recent report by the United Nations shed light on the disturbing reality of violence against women globally, revealing that an average of 140 women are killed every day (emphasis added) most often at the hands of those closest to them. The report, which examined femicide – the gender-based killing of women – raised alarming concerns about the safety of women, particularly within their own homes, with intimate partners and family members being the leading perpetrators.\\n\\nIn 2023 alone, a staggering 85,000 women were killed by men (emphasis added). Of these, more than 51,000 were murdered by their husbands or close family members, highlighting the intimate and dangerous nature of the violence women face. Shockingly, the report stated that 60% of all female homicide cases were committed by male relatives, underscoring the vulnerability of women in their own households.\\n\\nConclusions\\n\\nI did a podcast with four women offenders who, unexpectedly, told me of their sexual abuse as children by family or people they knew. Studies estimate that 50-80% of incarcerated women have experienced physical or sexual abuse at some point in their lives. This includes violence in childhood (e.g., sexual abuse by family members) and adulthood (e.g., intimate partner violence)​ per the Urban Institute and​ Amnesty International USA.\\n\\nI have read data where a rehabilitation program in Bosten reported that virtually all the women studied reported child and adult sex abuse and violence.\\n\\nI attended a group counseling event for males on probation convicted of spouse abuse. Several could not understand why it was illegal to beat their significant others.\\n\\nI’m not sure what happened between me being told as a young man that only cowards hit women and circumstances today. As a former cop, husband, and father of two daughters, I feel that this issue takes on an extreme sense of importance.\\n\\nFew female offenders can completely escape a history of abuse; it leads to substance and mental health issues. It was once suggested to me that a sexually abused female (by people she knew) could never overcome her trauma without intensive counseling and treatment.\\n\\nI did public affairs training in a women’s prerelease correctional center (they had a culinary arts program thus free food). I took a two-hour break in the courtyard while others did their presentations. I was surrounded by women inmates who told me that prison was the first time in their lives that they were not being beaten or abused by men. They got medical care and job training. They told me that prison was often a better alternative than being in the community.\\n\\nPolice officers on patrol have limited ability to stop the abuse of girls and women. Most happen in residential settings. This becomes a societal issue far more than a criminal justice initiative (which applies to all forms of violence).\\n\\nCrimes against females (and frankly, all violence) need to be a priority for every member of society. Whether it’s outrageously violent and sexist “music” or other forms of “entertainment,” the promotion of violence needs to stop, and only society and the entertainment industry have that power."},

"6770bbd76933901ae1d3ca38"}, "text": "On December 16, 2024, the Government of Canada released its 2024 Fall Economic Statement (\"the Statement\"). While reiterating previous objectives and commitments to protect human rights in supply chains, the Statement announced next steps on supply chain due diligence legislation and measures that will strengthen Canada's existing import ban.1\\n\\nCanada currently maintains an import ban on goods made of forced and child labour, and requires certain entities to report annually on their efforts to fight forced labour in their supply chain.2 This new legislation would go much further by requiring businesses to take active steps to combat forced labour in their supply chains – not just report on any steps they are taking\\n\\n1. Supply Chain Due Diligence Legislation\\n\\nThe proposed supply chain due diligence legislation (\"the Due Diligence Act\") would require entities operating in Canada to engage with and scrutinize their supply chains for risks to fundamental human and labour rights, and require businesses to take definitive action to address and resolve such risks where found.3 In addition, the government proposed to introduce a new oversight agency to compliment this regime and ensure compliance.\\n\\nThis would build upon the current reporting regime under the Fighting Against Forced Labour and Child Labour in Supply Chains Act (\"the Reporting Act\") obligating certain entities to actually implement due diligence measures, rather than merely report on existing measures.\\n\\nIt is likely that the Due Diligence Act will eventually subsume and replace Canada's existing supply chains framework. Canada may follow suit with international partners in imposing a size threshold to determine to whom the Due Diligence Act applies – in the EU, for instance, companies formed within a Member State with over 1,000 employees and a net worldwide turnover of more than EUR 450,000,000 in the last financial year are obligated to comply with due diligence measures under the Directive.4 Other countries impose similar requirements to limit the legislation's applicability to specific enterprises.5\\n\\nUltimately, given the current state of change amongst governmental departments charged with such developments, we expect there to be a transition period related to the implementation of any new legislation. In addition, incorporating the lessons learned from the Reporting Act's implementation would assist to address some of the expected uncertainties inherent in any new Due Diligence Act.\\n\\nSupply Chain Due Diligence Regimes Internationally\\n\\nThough no definitive drafting has been proposed, it is likely that Canada's Due Diligence Act will reflect existing regimes across the globe. For example, the European Union, France, and Germany all have established, comprehensive due diligence regimes that require entities to closely monitor their supply chains.\\n\\nThe EU's Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive obligates certain entities to identify, prevent, mitigate, and account for forced labour within their operations and their supply chains as part of its broader human rights and environmental due diligence obligations.6 Both the Duty of Vigilance Law in France and the German Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chain obligate certain businesses to establish an internal vigilance plan that covers vigilance measures relating to, among others, violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms from both the company and its subcontractors or suppliers, including through supply chain mapping mechanisms and monitoring processes to follow up with subcontractors and suppliers.7\\n\\nIf Canada follows suit, it will likely require entities doing business in Canada with global supply chains to establish more stringent supply chain mapping and communications with supplier and vendor partners.\\n\\n2. Strengthening Canada's Import Ban on Goods Made with Forced Labour\\n\\nThe Statement additionally proposed 25.1 million dollars over two years, beginning in 2025-26, to implement legislative amendments to strengthen Canada's import ban on goods produced by forced labour.8 The funds would be provided to Global Affairs Canada and the Canada Border Services Agency.\\n\\nAccording to the Statement, the government intends to amend the existing ban to impose an onus on importers to demonstrate that their supply chains are free from forced and child labour. This may closely resemble the reverse onus in place in the United States under the Uyghur Forced Labour Prevention Act.\\n\\nNext Steps\\n\\nThe proposed measures will integrate ESG and sustainability standards into Canada's supply chain regime. Whilst details are not yet known, for example, size thresholds will play an important role in determining who must comply with the existing requirements, entities can still take certain steps to prepare for the eventual new Due Diligence Act. The McMillan team will report when further information becomes available.\\n\\nMany entities in Canada are likely already exposed to human rights due diligence regimes globally by virtue of being subcontractors and suppliers to businesses subject to those regimes. The government's proposed measures will likely align Canada with international partners and standards, and may help avoid future trade restrictions in jurisdictions where human rights and due diligence obligations are already in place.\\n\\nNonetheless, entities should now consider engaging in further internal supply chain tracing mechanisms and ensuring they have good visibility into their suppliers and vendors. Practically, the proposed legislation will require entities to invest into systems, training, and expertise to wholly address supply chain concerns and mitigate the risk of legal liability for non-compliance. Entities should proactively consider implementing supply chain mapping, internal policy development, training and awareness campaigns, stakeholder engagement, and supply chain monitoring mechanisms. Finally, entities should now prepare for filing their annual mandatory forced labour and child labour in supply chains reports, which are due in most cases by than May 31, 2025.\\n\\nMcMillan LLP advises Canadian and international entities on their obligations under Canada's supply chains regime, and in implementing compliant ESG and human rights due diligence-based measures in businesses' operations. Our team remains available to assist in navigating changing compliance landscapes.\\n\\nThe foregoing provides only an overview and does not constitute legal advice. Readers are cautioned against making any decisions based on this material alone. Rather, specific legal advice should be obtained.\\n\\nFootnotes\\n\\n1.

Government of La Union and socio-civic organization La Union Vibrant Women, Inc. (LUVWI), PLDT and Smart strengthen their fight against online sexual abuse and exploitation of children (OSAEC), through a learning session entitled, “Better Today for Kids: Bata, Bata Kami ang Iyong Kasangga”. The session was attended by teachers, parents, students, and youth leaders from La Union, who gained valuable information on how they can become the first line of safety and protection of their families in the digital world.\\n\\nSave the Children leads the discussion on children’s rights and online sexual abuse and exploitation of children (OSAEC).\\n\\n“We see the children and youth as our youngest and most vulnerable digital citizens. This is at the core of why we implement programs such as our Better Today for Kids, as a way to raise awareness on the dangers and threats that lurk in the digital environment. Through this, it is our hope that we are able to create safer spaces for our children and youth as they navigate the online space,” said Stephanie V. Orlino, AVP and Head of Stakeholder Management at PLDT and Smart.\\n\\n“I really try to find ways to help everyone – from parents to the children. Through the help of PLDT and Smart and Save the Children, we are able to create impactful programs that help protect our children, especially in the digital space. We need to remember that, as parents and guardians, we are the first line of safety and defense of our children. But it is also important that we protect ourselves from the dangers that are happening online,” said LUVWI Chairperson Joy Ortega.\\n\\n“[Through this training], we are able to know more about Anti-Online Sexual Abuse and Exploitation of Children. We were able to know the limitations of the actions and words in relation to OSAEC and identify ways to spot abuse. We hope to share and help spread awareness on the things we have learned during this training on Anti-OSAEC,” said LUVWI member Lilian D. Tan.\\n\\n“The training on OSAEC equipped me with the knowledge and skills to recognize the risks of online sexual abuse and exploitation, protect myself and others, and report incidents to the proper authorities. It empowered me to become a responsible individual and an advocate for a safer environment,” said Roderick Orfiano, Teacher I from Almeida Elementary School.\\n\\nA Scale of Harm study by the International Justice Mission revealed that almost half a million Filipino children were trafficked to produce new child sexual exploitation materials in 2022. While foreign men are the primary consumers of these illicit content, their facilitators are locals who are often known to the victims.\\n\\nZaena Saripada, who serves as the Community Development Officer of SaferKidsPH, talked about children’s rights and the heinous crimes of the perpetrator against the victims. “The Philippines remains to be a global hotspot for OSAEC. It is important that the children and youth become aware of the dangers of the online space as perpetrators lurk and lure their victims,” said Saripada.\\n\\nSaferKidsPH, an Australian Government initiative, is delivered through the pioneering consortium of Save the Children Philippines, The Asia Foundation and UNICEF to prevent OSAEC in the Philippines. SaferKidsPH works with children and their families, the Philippine Government, civil society and the private sector to ensure that children are safe and protected online.\\n\\nPLDT and Smart champion a whole-of-nation approach to curtail OSAEC. Besides its pioneering child protection platform, the PLDT Group works with various allies to advocate for and protect children’s rights.\\n\\nThese efforts underscore PLDT and Smart’s commitment to helping the Philippines attain UNSDG 16, which promotes just, peaceful, and inclusive societies and end the abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence against children."}, "meta": {},

their adventurous spirit and willingness to cross oceans in search of better opportunities. However, in their pursuit of foreign dreams, many fail to recognise the red flags of too-good-to-be-true job offers, often finding themselves in serious trouble.\\n\\nNow, the Kerala Government’s Department of Non-Resident Keralites Affairs (NORKA) has raised the alarm about a chilling new threat: human trafficking syndicates luring unsuspecting job seekers to Southeast Asian nations such as Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam, only to trap them in cybercrime operations.\\n\\nAccording to NORKA officials, scammers exploit job seekers’ vulnerabilities by presenting lucrative opportunities, weaving an intricate web of deception through flashy advertisements on social media platforms and promises made by unscrupulous agents.\\n\\nThese so-called “recruiters” entice victims with seemingly irresistible offers for positions such as digital sales and marketing executives, customer support agents, telecallers, and data entry operators. Promises include generous salaries, five-star hotel accommodations, return air tickets, visa assistance, and other extravagant perks. Applicants are further lulled into a false sense of legitimacy by an application process that appears professional and straightforward.\\n\\nVictims are often recruited through online or in-person interviews, followed by simple tests like typing exams. However, the harsh reality is that many of these roles are allegedly linked to industries such as cryptocurrency fraud, banking fraud, illegal stock trading, call centre scams, honey trapping, and other illicit online activities.\\n\\nSmuggled into the shadows\\n\\nOnce “hired”, the unsuspecting, often eager job seekers are illegally smuggled across borders, frequently from Thailand into the Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone in Laos – a notorious hub for criminal enterprises. Neighbouring countries such as Cambodia, Myanmar, and Vietnam are also reported to host these sinister operations.\\n\\nUpon arrival, victims find themselves living a nightmare. Stripped of their freedom, they are held captive and coerced into participating in illegal activities. The once-promising job in digital marketing or customer service transforms into a life of relentless exploitation, where they are forced to engage in:\\n\\nOnline scams: Carrying out fraudulent schemes over the phone or internet.\\n\\nMining and timber work: Gruelling physical labour under inhumane conditions.\\n\\nCryptocurrency fraud and honey trapping: Deceptive operations targeting vulnerable individuals worldwide.\\n\\nAlso read: 60 Indian nationals rescued from Cambodia return to Indi\\n\\nA cycle of exploitation\\n\\nAccording to NORKA officials, forced labour is the least of the victims’ worries.\\n\\n“Compared with other states, Keralites who fell victims are comparatively low. But some cases have been reported. Going by their accounts, victims are subjected to unthinkable physical and mental torture. Surveillance is constant, and any resistance is met with severe punishment, including beatings and starvation. These individuals are stripped of their dignity, treated as commodities rather than human beings,” said an official.\\n\\nThe psychological toll of the exploitation is equally devastating. Victims live in constant fear, enduring threats to their lives and their families. Many lose hope, trapped in a cycle of abuse, manipulation, and despair. The perpetrators ensure complete submission by isolating their captives and instilling a sense of helplessness.\\n\\n“You can see such victims across the country. Indian embassies have stepped in to rescue victims from these perilous conditions. Diplomatic efforts have helped save numerous lives, bringing them back to safety. However, the scars of this ordeal remain, both physical and emotional,” added the official.\\n\\nA call for vigilance\\n\\nThe chilling accounts of victims serve as a stark reminder for job seekers to remain vigilant and cautious.\\n\\n“Indian nationals must be aware that visa-on-arrival facilities in Southeast Asian countries strictly prohibit employment. Individuals arriving on such visas are not granted work permits by the respective authorities,” says NORKA.\\n\\nTourist visas, similarly, are intended solely for tourism purposes and cannot be used for any form of employment. Those intending to work in Southeast Asian countries must ensure they secure employment only through authorised recruitment agents.\\n\\n“It is crucial to thoroughly verify the background and credibility of prospective foreign employers. To avoid falling victim to fraudulent job offers, especially those circulating on social media or other unverified platforms, individuals should validate the authenticity of the foreign employer through the Indian embassy in the respective country,” said the official.\\n\\nAdditionally, the e-Migrate portal of the Ministry of External Affairs provides a reliable resource for checking whether the recruiting agent and the company in India are licensed and legitimate.\\n\\nNORKA further provides details of Indian embassies to contact in case of emergencies:\\n\\nThailand: Emergency Mobile Number: +66-618819218, Email: cons.bangkok@mea.gov.in\\n\\nCambodia: Emergency Mobile Number: +855-92881676, Email: cons.phnompenh@mea.gov.in, visa.phnompenh@mea.gov.in\\n\\nMyanmar: Mobile Number: +9595419602 (WhatsApp/Viber/Signal), Email: cons.yangon@mea.gov.in\\n\\nLaos: Emergency Mobile Number: +856-2055536568, Email: cons.vientianne@mea.gov.in\\n\\nVietnam: Emergency Mobile Number: +84-913089165, Email: cons.hanoi@mea.gov.in / pptvisa.hanoi@mea.gov.in\\n\\nA global crisis\\n\\nIn 2023, Interpol declared human trafficking linked to Southeast Asian cyber scam centres a global crisis. The United Nations reported that over 100,000 people were trafficked into Cambodia’s scam industry that year, generating over $2 trillion in illicit capital.\\n\\nThe Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a nonprofit policy research organisation, estimated that cyber scams in the region generate $43.8 billion annually, fuelling activities such as drug and arms trafficking, sexual exploitation, exotic pet smuggling, and militias linked to Myanmar’s military junta, which has been accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity.\\n\\nIn July, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar raised the issue with Myanmar and Thailand, emphasising the need for stronger anti-cybercrime mechanisms at the ASEAN Regional Forum in Laos to protect regional security and stability.\\n\\n(Edited by Dese Gowda)"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.713630Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-07T08:10:29.133426Z", "inner_id": 134, "total_annotations": 2,

"As the number of cases rise involving impersonation on phone and video calls, leading to citizens losing crores of rupees, fraudsters have now turned to emails to trick unsuspecting people.\\n\\nMeanwhile, officials of the Telangana cybercrime police urged citizens not to fall for these tactics.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, a journalist in Hyderabad received an ‘official court order’ from the ‘Cyber Security Agency of Saudi Arabia’ claiming the victim were accessing ‘juvenile pornographic websites’. The email further warned of ‘legal action’ if the victim did not respond within 24 hours.\\n\\n“By the mandate of Col. Khalid Abdullah, additional director general, ADG headquarter and cyber crime & economic offense department, conducted an analysis of your internet protocol. This analysis revealed that you have been secretly accessing juvenile pornographic websites through your office or home internet,” the email read.\\n\\nThe email claimed that the ministry of home affairs works closely with the special cell of Saudi Arabia police and the department’s advanced digital forensics labs are equipped to detect any access to child pornography websites, recover deleted data, and analyse various devices.\\n\\n“Fraudsters are adopting new methods to con people. This tactic builds on existing impersonation and digital arrest scams where conmen posing as government officials trap unsuspecting individuals and coerce them into paying their way out of trouble. Once a victim responds, they weave the narrative of serious charges levied against them and leave them with only one option,” explained Chand Basha, Assistant Commissioner of Police, Hyderabad Cybercrimes.\\n\\nThis comes at a time when the Hyderabad citizens lost ₹296 crore to cyber criminals in 2024. This number was a staggering ₹793 crore in Cyberabad, with close to a 900% rise in digital arrest cases.\\n\\nAnother official from the Telangana Cyber Security Bureau (TGCSB) clarified that the email address itself is fake. Citizens are advised to not respond to such emails. Instead, block or report them immediately, the official added.\\n\\nThe email was sent from ‘police.intelligence.office@nicwebmail.info’ with a fabricated reference number ‘39724-34-01/ICB-IPHQ/2024’. A quick background check of the domain showed that the Internet Protocol (IP) address originated from Friedrichshain in Berlin. It was created on November 28, 2024 and was updated on December 16, 2024.\\n\\nEarlier this year, the Ministry of Home Affairs’ cyber-safety and cyber security awareness handle flagged concern over a fake letter circulating on social media, claiming to be from the Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre (I4C) CEO Rajesh Kumar. The fraudulent letter accused the recipient of engaging in child pornography and paedophilia and was accompanied by an email that mirrored the language used in this recent scam."}, "meta": {},

"6770bbd76933901ae1d3ca59"}, "text": "Trigger warning: Descriptions of child exploitation, abuse, and inhumane labour conditions\\n\\nOctober 12, 2023, began like any other day for most of India. However, in the Wazipur Industrial Area of New Delhi, a grim reality was playing out. In a cramped, hidden room, 12 children, aged five to 10, were living through unimaginable hardship.\\n\\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows over the city, these young souls, mere specks of humanity, toiled tirelessly. For them, 17 hours stretched into an endless cycle of forced labour, their tiny bodies confined as bonded labourers.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nBut on this particular day, the doors of their prison-like workspace finally swung open, allowing them to experience sunlight after many tiring days of labour.\\n\\nThe children were reassured, establishing that they were there to help.\\n\\nA team of NGO workers, accompanied by the police and collaborating with other departments, performed a quick and organised rescue mission. “They were overjoyed to finally experience the outside world and begin a life like any other child,” says Harish Kumar, a sentiment made possible by the successful rescue mission facilitated by ‘Sahog Care For You’.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nFounded in 2002 by Shekhar Mahajan and some like-minded friends with the aim of providing quality education to children, the Delhi-based organisation has expanded its scope to address various societal issues.\\n\\n‘What will he gain from school?’\\n\\nBonded labour is a harsh reality in India, affecting countless lives despite being prohibited under the Child Labour (Prohibition & Regulation) Act, 1986. It persists in both rural and urban areas, driven by poverty, illiteracy, and entrenched social inequalities.\\n\\nThese children are not only deprived of education but also robbed of their childhoods. Addressing this complex issue requires a multi-faceted approach, including identifying exploitative industries, strict enforcement of laws, community-level awareness campaigns, and comprehensive rehabilitation programmes to break the cycle of exploitation.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nShekhar, a lawyer by profession, and a graduate in social work, found his legal practice unfulfilling. He yearned for a deeper impact and believed himself to be an agent of change, addressing the societal disparities he witnessed.\\n\\nSahyog Care For You ensures the child does not return to the vicious cycle of physical work.\\n\\n“I wanted to change my life based on my passion for giving back to society. I wanted to build a career that allowed me to earn a living while making a meaningful difference,” Shekhar tells The Better India.\\n\\nA pivotal moment arrived during a visit to a resettlement colony with a friend. Witnessing a young boy assisting his father at a makeshift tea stall, Shekhar observed the father’s indifference towards the child’s education. “What will he gain from school? He’s helping me here,” the father dismissed.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThis posed a profound question for Shekhar: What future awaited the child without education? The realisation ignited a spark within him, inspiring him to dedicate his career to providing quality education for underprivileged children.\\n\\nChildren are rescued from factories in India and given the life they deserve.\\n\\nWhile the idea was promising, Shekhar faced significant financial struggles to establish what he envisioned. “Corporates did not come forward to provide funding due to lack of CSR mandate in 2002,” says Shekhar. He started the organisation with the minimal amount received from supportive friends and family.\\n\\n“When I discussed the idea with my friends, they were happy with the initiative, but their follow-up question was regarding the money. But I only needed their moral support and to stand by me while I take this forward,” says Shekhar, who started the organisation in 2002.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe NGO works in multiple verticals like education, skill development and entrepreneurship, focusing on the benefit of children, women, youngsters, and bonded labourers.\\n\\nOver the past five years, Sahyog has collaborated closely with governmental departments to conduct 148 successful missions, rescuing more than 2,788 children (2,065 boys and 723 girls) from exploitation.\\n\\nThe organisation focuses on liberating victims and reintegrating them into society through counselling, education, and skill development.\\n\\nGenerations lost: The hidden scars of child labour\\n\\nVulnerable individuals, especially from marginalised communities, can be trapped in exploitative debt cycles, frequently small and fabricated. This forces families to send their children to work as labourers to repay the debt, perpetuating a cycle of poverty and exploitation, Shekhar informs. Alarmingly, many child labourers in India — estimated at 10.1 million by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) — are forced to work in extremely hazardous industries.\\n\\n“Children are cheap labour for factory owners. They are in a vulnerable position where they do not voice their opinions or difficulties like adults. Moreover, parents are under the assumption that their child is working in a safe environment and getting three meals a day. Despite the struggle, the child continues to work thinking that their family is receiving the monetary benefit,” shares Harish Kumar, the rescue and rehabilitation manager at Sahyog.\\n\\n“I am a father of two daughters. Whenever I look at these children suffering under harsh circumstances due to financial downfall and illiteracy, I think of my children and how I would feel if such a situation arose in my family. Sometimes it becomes difficult to sleep as I am reminded of the difficult childhood the children are experiencing,” he adds.\\n\\nChild labourers working in unsafe conditions for prolonged hours.\\n\\nWhile the number of children rescued varies from mission to mission — sometimes 70, and other times as few as two — each successful rescue brings them closer to creating a safe and comfortable environment for vulnerable children.\\n\\nHowever, the missions are not devoid of setbacks and challenges. Shekhar recalls an incident when the organisation received information regarding a bonded labourer of 12 to 13 years old; he was being pressured to work overtime with a steel-cutting machine.\\n\\n“We had filed the complaint and completed the pre-rescue meeting, and we were supposed to conduct the rescue mission around 11 am. I was disheartened when I found out that the child had lost two fingers at 10:30 am on the same day. I consider this a failure as if we had gone 30 minutes before, and we could have saved the child’s fingers,” shares Shekhar.\\n\\nEmpowering the future: Rescue and rehabilitation\\n\\nEmphasising the crucial role NGOs play, Harish informs that the complete details regarding the factories, workers, etc, are provided by the team involved in the recce and investigation process.\\n\\n“The impact of a rescue mission and the pressure built creates fear among other factory owners to not be involved in such practices,” Shekhar adds. Following a tip-off from the workers or the society, the NGO initiates the identification process by having its members examine the area thoroughly, he informs.\\n\\n“We assess factories, identifying factors like the number of child workers, their tasks, working conditions, and any instances of physical or mental exploitation,” explains Harish. “In areas like Wazirpur, industrialists are highly vigilant with constant CCTV surveillance, prompting the rescue team to often resort to undercover tactics, entering factories disguised as workers. The entry and exit of vehicles during the mission is mapped to perfection.”\\n\\nAfter gathering the necessary evidence, a written complaint is filed with the Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM). Subsequently, a pre-rescue meeting is convened by the SDM or the District Magistrate (DM), bringing together representatives from various departments, including labour, revenue, police, medical, and the Child Welfare Committee (CWC).\\n\\nThe rescue mission is done where multiple Government departments are involved.\\n\\n“While the SOP demands the completion of the rescue mission 48 hours after the meeting, the involvement of multiple departments and the availability of the SDM sometimes delays the process,” Shekhar admits.\\n\\n“Since we are the facilitators for the rescue mission, we become the witness for the same. The Government deals with proper documentation of the details. All the FIR copies are maintained by us to keep track of the conducted and upcoming missions,” he adds.\\n\\nThe date and time for the rescue mission are fixed without revealing details like the address and factory name to avoid external hurdles and challenges.\\n\\n“Sometimes political pressure and involvement of goons makes the rescue tricky,” says Shekhar. “We get threats via calls and messages; we also have been harmed and threatened earlier. To avoid this, we request an additional police force and take them during the rescue to handle the situation effectively,” he adds.\\n\\nFollowing a successful rescue, the children undergo a thorough medical examination to assess for signs of abuse, physical and mental, and other health issues due to exposure to hazardous factories like coating, steel, utensils, embroidery, and the like. “Unfortunately, sexual abuse remains a significant concern, particularly for girls,” Shekhar says.\\n\\nThe Child Welfare Committee (CWC) subsequently places the children in Child Care Institutes (CCIs) for rehabilitation until they can be reunited with their families. Comprehensive counselling is provided for both the children and their parents so that they don’t get into the vicious circle of bonded labour.\\n\\nMost of the time, these children are not given the wages for the tiresome work done but are underpaid and forced to live in pathetic conditions. To ensure the children receive their rightful compensation, the Labour Department takes responsibility for settling the back wages for the children; until then, the factory remains sealed. “Halting production increases the financial pressure on the factory owner, incentivising them to settle the outstanding payments quickly,” shares Shekhar.\\n\\n“We also provide ration supplies enough for a month to the rescued children as we don’t want them or their families to think of the children as a financial burden. We provide whatever the child needs — clothes, stationary, depending on their needs,” Harish reiterates.\\n\\nSharing smiles\\n\\nOne rescue mission that remains etched in Shekhar’s memory involved locating a nine-year-old girl working as a domestic servant in North Delhi. “The only lead we had was an intermittent phone number provided by her father, who had reported to the Odisha police to find his daughter, stating that she had been taken away for a sum of Rs 10,000,” he shares.\\n\\nWorking closely with the police department, they tracked the phone number and pinpointed the general location. However, identifying the individual behind the number proved challenging, requiring four days of intensive investigation.\\n\\n“Despite the difficulties, the joy of witnessing the father and daughter reunite after four years made every effort worthwhile. That profound sense of fulfilment drives me in this challenging work,” shares Shekhar, representing everybody who works under challenging circumstances.\\n\\nTo provide a comfortable future for the children, they are enrolled in schools to exercise their fundamental right — education. “Adolescent children, due to the monotony of work, refuse to take up studies personally. For them, vocational courses like computer classes, stitching, retail, BPO, and beauty courses are facilitated so they can excel in a particular skill and make a decent living,” shares Harish.\\n\\nThese vocational courses have helped build a career for the children. “As someone who has had a difficult childhood economically, these vocational training centres have helped me establish a career of my own, live a dignified life, and now help people like me,” Harish smiles.\\n\\nVocational courses like computer, stitching, BPO, are taught in the centres.\\n\\nThe centres by Sahyog teach free-of-cost courses for rescued children and the underprivileged at Rs 50 per month. To date, 22 such centres are functioning in and around Delhi. “This eliminates them from being in a vulnerable position of going back to the dark chambers of the factory,” shares Shekhar.\\n\\n“I used to work in a car manufacturing company, enduring gruelling 10-hour shifts with just a single lunch break,” recalls Dev, a former child labourer who was once trapped in bonded labour.\\n\\nToday, at 18 years of age, Dev thrives as a data operator, earning a respectable monthly income of Rs 15,000. “The computer skills I acquired through the vocational training, which I did for one year, have not only improved my livelihood but also enabled me to support my family,” Dev shares. He hopes to earn a salary of Rs 1 lakh per month in the future.\\n\\nEdited by Arunava Banerjee; All image courtesy- Sahyog Care For You"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.713714Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-07T08:11:00.489217Z", "inner_id": 139, "total_annotations": 2, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60832, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 144951434, "annotations": [{"id": 53021917, "completed_by": {"id": 60833, "email": "sskanuk@gmail.com", "first_name": "", "last_name": ""}, "result": [{"id": "5w74suG4pP", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Incident"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}, {"id": "lZUSwr03FH", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Minor", "Sexual Abuse"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "coercion_classifier"}, {"id": "DC9fFrMkNw", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "recruitment_classifier"}, {"id": "rQFmP8ApcM", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "transport_classifier"}, {"id": "jtRW6mNJkx", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Child Trafficking", "Child Sexual Exploitation", "Sexual Exploitation"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_classifier"}, {"id": "WggzDlx54_", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Online Sexual Exploitation", "Pornography"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_sub_classifier"}], "reviews": [], "history": [{"id": 57967143, "comment": null, "organization_id": 34950, "project_id": 122257, "annotation_id": 53021917, "draft_id": null, "review_id": null, "task_id": 144951434, "result": [{"id": "5w74suG4pP", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Incident"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}, {"id": "lZUSwr03FH", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Minor", "Sexual Abuse"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "coercion_classifier"}, {"id": "DC9fFrMkNw", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "recruitment_classifier"}, {"id": "rQFmP8ApcM", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "transport_classifier"}, {"id": "jtRW6mNJkx", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Child Trafficking", "Child Sexual Exploitation", "Sexual Exploitation"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_classifier"}, {"id": "WggzDlx54_", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Online Sexual Exploitation", "Pornography"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_sub_classifier"}], "lead_time": 68.348, "action": "submitted", "started_at": "2025-01-23T16:34:49.562000Z", "created_at": "2025-01-23T16:35:58.288429Z", "created_by": 60833, "comment_id": null}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-01-23T16:35:58.174960Z", "updated_at": "2025-01-23T16:35:58.174971Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-01-23T16:34:58.702394Z", "lead_time": 68.348, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 6, "unique_id": "d89daf8b-ae92-4b05-bbf3-16360a62e0d5", "import_id": null, "last_action": "submitted", "bulk_created": false, "task": 144951434, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60833, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": 60833}], "file_upload": "2d869759-batch_5_data.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "agreement": 100.0, "data": {"_id": {"$oid": "6770bbd76933901ae1d3ca6b"}, "text": "Share with friends\\n\\nTHOMAS – The Georgia Bureau of Investigation has arrested a 42-year-old Georgia man on four counts of Sexual Exploitation of Children.\\n\\nRelease:\\n\\nOn Wednesday, December 18, 2024, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation Child Exploitation and Computer Crimes (CEACC) Unit arrested and charged Harold Ryan, age 42, of McDuffie County, Georgia, with four counts of Sexual Exploitation of Children.\\n\\nAn investigation into Ryan’s illicit online activity began in September 2024 after receiving numerous CyberTips from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children involving possession of child sexual abuse material.

Police officials said hese charges stem from an incident involving a 4-year-old girl under his care who suffered serious injuries, including a brain bIeed, severe maInutrition and other health problems. Alongside 29-year-old J. Lam, 26-year-old Derreck and 23-year-old AireaI were also taken into custody and are now facing the same charges. According to authorities in Missouri, all three defendants live together in the same house.\\n\\nThe investigation process began earlier this month after the 4-year-old child, who was not identified due to her age, was rushed to the hospital with severe injuries. The child was then airlifted to a bigger hospital due to the severity of her injuries, police officials said. During the investigation process, authorities in Missouri discovered that the child had bruises all over her body, especially around her torso. The 4-year-old girl also suffered brain bIeed and had an altered mental status.\\n\\nThe doctors told investigators that the child was severely malnourished and also had several cavities in her teeth. During an interview with investigators, one of her caregivers, 29-year-old Lam, reportedly said that the child fell down the stairs several days before she was rushed to the hospital. Authorities said that doctors determined that the child’s injuries were not consistent with the caregiver’s story because according to them, stair falls do not cause major head trauma and it would be unusual for the brain injury to take over a week to develop, local news outlet KMZU reported.\\n\\nAccording to the hospital staff, these kind of falls don’t cause extensive bruising like the child had and the torso bruising is concerning for abuse. During a follow-up interview with investigator, the 29-year-old caregiver also said that he called his parent, who according to him is a medical professional, after the child fell. The unidentified woman reportedly told him to treat the child’s pain with TyIenol and lbuprofen. The man also told authorities that he has anger problems, adding that he was angry to himself for being a failure, but never took his anger out on anybody else.\\n\\nDuring the investigation process, authorities learned that another child, 1-year-old baby, was in the same household. Authorities discovered that the baby was also neglected and removed the child from their custody.

To counter this issue, a simple yet ingenious solution involving spoons has emerged as a life-saving strategy.\\n\\nAdvertisment\\n\\nForced Marriages: A Hidden Crisis\\n\\nForced marriages involve coercing individuals into wedlock without their consent, often accompanied by threats, violence, or emotional blackmail. Unlike arranged marriages where consent is obtained, forced marriages strip individuals of choice. In 2017 alone, the UK's Forced Marriage Unit (FMU) handled over 1,500 cases, with 82 linked to India. Other countries frequently involved included Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Somalia, as reported by The Journal.\\n\\nCultural pressures tied to concepts of \"izzat\" (family honour) often push families to enforce these unions, sometimes to secure visas or maintain traditions. Survivors, many of them minors, face severe consequences, including abuse, exile, or even honour killings, for resisting.\\n\\nThe Spoon Trick\\n\\nA Leeds schoolteacher, Harinder Kaur, and the Karma Nirvana charity introduced the \"spoon trick\" as a way for potential victims to alert authorities discreetly. By hiding a metal spoon in their undergarments, individuals can trigger airport security detectors, providing them a private moment to inform staff of their predicament.\\n\\nAdvertisment\\n\\nAirports such as Heathrow, Liverpool, and Glasgow have been trained to spot signs of forced marriages, including one-way tickets, young travellers, and visible distress. Upon detection, security personnel escort survivors to a safe space for confidential assistance.\\n\\nThis method is particularly crucial during the summer holidays, a peak time for forced marriages as families exploit school breaks to take children abroad.\\n\\nThe Grim Consequences of Forced Marriages\\n\\nSurvivors often endure physical, emotional, and sexual abuse. One survivor recounted being sent to India, raped by her husband, and subjected to years of violence. Tragically, some cases end in suicides or honour killings.\\n\\nWhile most survivors are young girls aged 15-16, forced marriages also affect men, with 18% of FMU cases in 2017 involving male survivors. Children as young as two and adults as old as 71 have been reported.\\n\\nGovernment and Community Efforts\\n\\nAdvertisment\\n\\nThe FMU, established in 2005, provides critical support both domestically and internationally. It operates hotlines, offers consular aid, and raises awareness about the dangers of forced marriages.\\n\\nThe FMU emphasises that no major religion condones forced marriages.

The Charter Oak High School teacher, who has been identified as Joshua Daniel McGinn (41), faces multiple charges, including the following: Four felony counts of oral copulation on a minor\\n\\nOne felony count of a sexual penetration by use of force\\n\\nOne felony count of sexual penetration by use of force\\n\\nTwo felony counts of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor\\n\\nOne felony count of possession of child pornography This information was made available by the Los Angeles County District Attorney in a news release on Tuesday. According to authorities, “prosecutors from [the] Sex Crimes Division are working tirelessly to ensure justice is served for the victims and their families. [They] also want to encourage anyone who may have additional information or has been victimized to come forward and report information to the Covina Police Department.” The Covina teacher was arrested on December 18, 2024 and is being held without bail, according to officials. McGinn is scheduled to be arraigned on January 6, 2024. If he is convicted, he faces up to 13 years and 6 months in prison. The sexual abuse occurred while McGinn was a teacher with the Charter Oak Unified School District, specifically in 2022. The abuse was reported to the Police Department. Unfortunately, the sexual abuse of students at the hands of teachers is very common. Teachers and other trusted adults in schools take advantage of their positions to abuse minors. In many cases, the minors do not report the abuse because they are afraid that they will face further abuse or they simply do not believe that anything will be done about the abuse. However, it is important to note that students that suffered sexual abuse at the hands of teachers have the right to take action – against the teacher that attacked them, the school, and the school district.

Of course, you could pursue criminal charges against the attacker, whether it is a teacher or any other school staff. However, you could also pursue a civil lawsuit against the school – or the school district – that employed the teacher. This is because school districts have the duty to keep students safe. When hiring teachers and any other school staff, they must subject them to background checks, appropriate training, and supervision. They must also have appropriate policies and procedures to be able to identify and address reports of abuse. When schools or districts fail to identify abuse, fail to address abuse when reports are made, or cover up abuse, they can be liable for all resulting harm and could be sued.

ET. 2 Minute Read, By Art Fletcher: Englebrook Independent News,\\n\\nGREENBELT, MD.- On Friday, December 20, 2024, Brian Patrick Werth, 40, of Beltsville, Maryland, appeared in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland and was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Theodore D. Chuang to 444 months in federal prison, to be followed by twenty-five years of supervised release for his conviction on two counts of Production of Child Pornograpy.\\n\\nAccording to U.S. Attorney Erek L. Barron, Werth was convicted at trial of coercing and enticing a child to engage in sexually explicit conduct and engaging a child as a registered sex offender.\\n\\nDuring Friday’s sentencing hearing, in addition to the term of imprisonment, Judge Chuang ordered Werth, upon release from prison, to register as a sex offender in the national database, to have no contact with children under the age of eighteen and be subject to computer monitoring.\\n\\nWerth Convicted By Federal Jury\\n\\nFollowing a three-day trial, a federal jury found that from January 2021 through June 2021, Werth communicated with minor girls, ages eleven and sixteen, through online applications, WhatsApp and Kik. During the communications, Werth persuaded, coerced, and enticed the young girls to engage in sexually explicit by producing sexually explicit videos of themselves and then requesting them to send the videos to him.\\n\\nAdditionally, Werth engaged in the sexual exploitation of the two children while being registered as a sex offender listed on the Maryland Sex Offender Register for a previous sex offense conviction.\\n\\nWerth Previously Convicted Of Sexually Abusing Teen Girl\\n\\nIn 2016, Werth, a youth minister at St. Elizabeth’s Catholic Church in Rockville, Maryland, was arrested and charged in connection with the sexual abuse of a then 16-year-old girl who was a parishioner at the church. In 2018, Werth, following his conviction, was sentenced by a Montgomery County Judge to 3 years in Maryland State Prison on the charges of second-degree Sexual Assault and a fourth-degree Sex Offense."}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.713863Z", "updated_at": "2025-01-31T01:54:48.909301Z", "inner_id": 148, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60833, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 144951443, "annotations": [{"id": 53781458, "completed_by": {"id": 60834, "email": "ankitamanna1@gmail.com", "first_name": "", "last_name": ""}, "result": [{"id": "rvvZfoWsZg", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Incident"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}, {"id": "mby5TClpoP", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "coercion_classifier"}, {"id": "Rtsc8Dnju_", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "recruitment_classifier"}, {"id": "-Bt-DQC_oE", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "transport_classifier"}, {"id": "QS_7k6MYAm", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_classifier"}, {"id": "pUlhFnIL4p", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_sub_classifier"}], "reviews": [], "history": [{"id": 58859762, "comment": null, "organization_id": 34950, "project_id": 122257, "annotation_id": 53781458, "draft_id": null, "review_id": null, "task_id": 144951443, "result": [{"id": "rvvZfoWsZg", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Incident"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}, {"id": "mby5TClpoP", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "coercion_classifier"}, {"id": "Rtsc8Dnju_", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "recruitment_classifier"}, {"id": "-Bt-DQC_oE", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "transport_classifier"}, {"id": "QS_7k6MYAm", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_classifier"}, {"id": "pUlhFnIL4p", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_sub_classifier"}], "lead_time": 387.191, "action": "submitted", "started_at": "2025-02-03T18:12:44.819000Z", "created_at": "2025-02-03T18:19:10.867310Z", "created_by": 60834, "comment_id": null}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-03T18:19:10.740394Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-03T18:19:10.740404Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-02-03T18:19:04.624030Z", "lead_time": 387.191, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 6, "unique_id": "d1823880-a4a6-4d32-aa4d-780e6b585def", "import_id": null, "last_action": "submitted", "bulk_created": false, "task": 144951443, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60834, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": 60834}], "file_upload": "2d869759-batch_5_data.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "agreement": 100.0, "data": {"_id": {"$oid": "67720c7a351814a79e981138"}, "text": "There was a time when there was a pretty big business in migrants with visas coming up from Mexico and Central America to work agriculture, then going home when the job was done. Or even being in the US for a few years on a legal visa. Now, Democrats just want all the illegals and fake asylum seekers to clean their homes, do their yards, and pick their veggies and fruits\\n\\nTrump migrant deportations could threaten states’ agricultural economies If President-elect Donald Trump follows through on his pledge to deport millions of immigrants, it could upend the economies of states where farming and other food-related industries are crucial — and where labor shortages abound. Immigrants make up about two-thirds of the nation’s crop farmworkers, according to the U.S. Department of Labor, and roughly 2 in 5 of them are not legally authorized to work in the United States. Agricultural industries such as meatpacking, dairy farms and poultry and livestock farms also rely heavily on immigrants. “We have five to six employees that do the work that nobody else will do. We wouldn’t survive without them,” said Bruce Lampman, who owns Lampman Dairy Farm, in Bruneau, Idaho. His farm, which has been in the family three decades, has 350 cows producing some 26,000 pounds of milk a day. “My business and every agriculture business in the U.S. will be crippled if they want to get rid of everybody who does the work,” said Lampman, adding that his workers are worried about what’s to come.\\n\\nOK, so, is Lampman employing people not authorized to work in the U.S., be it due to being unlawfully present or fake asylum seekers? That would be illegal. If they are authorized to work, not problem. Unless they are a criminal. Does Lampman, and other companies, want murderers, rapists, child abusers, thieves, etc., working for them? Because those are whom the Trump admin will go after first.\\n\\nAnita Alves Pena, a Colorado State University professor of economics who studies immigration, noted that many agricultural employers already can’t find enough laborers. Without farm subsidies or other protections to make up for the loss of immigrant workers, she said, the harm to state economies could be significant.\\n\\nWell, how about getting legal migrant workers? What they really want is to pay these people minimum wage or less to do the job. Are they saying their business model relies on illegal aliens?\\n\\nHow about having those sentenced to jail work the fields? Do the agriculture business owners want these people?\\n\\nYou want them, business owners?\\n\\nMeanwhile\\n\\nMigrants can accrue profound emotional trauma when journeying to the US. Mental health workers are stretched thin. There’s a phrase in Haitian Creole that describes feelings of extreme stress, anxiety, or depression that are all too common among the thousands of new migrants arriving in Massachusetts: tet chaje. The literal translation is “burdened head,” a feeling of being overwhelmed. People who work with the state’s surging number of new arrivals, a majority of whom are from Haiti, hear the term often. Migrants may accrue profound emotional injury both in their home nations, where gang violence or state-sponsored oppression are common, and through the journey to the United States. Many experience rape and assault or witness the deaths of fellow travelers.\\n\\nCan anyone think of a solution so they do not that profound emotional trauma?\\n\\nShare this: Tweet\\n\\n\\n\\nEmail\\n\\nPocket\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you liked my post, feel free to subscribe to my rss feeds."}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.713879Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-03T18:19:10.814775Z", "inner_id": 149, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60834, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 144951444, "annotations": [{"id": 53663497, "completed_by": {"id": 60833, "email": "sskanuk@gmail.com", "first_name": "", "last_name": ""}, "result": [{"id": "r8zvnd_wtZ", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Irrelevant"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}], "reviews": [], "history": [{"id": 58706397, "comment": null, "organization_id": 34950, "project_id": 122257, "annotation_id": 53663497, "draft_id": null, "review_id": null, "task_id": 144951444, "result": [{"id": "r8zvnd_wtZ", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Irrelevant"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}], "lead_time": 2.699, "action": "submitted", "started_at": "2025-01-31T01:58:53.123000Z", "created_at": "2025-01-31T01:58:56.606414Z", "created_by": 60833, "comment_id": null}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-01-31T01:58:56.467528Z", "updated_at": "2025-01-31T01:58:56.467546Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 2.699, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "d8247b68-dd01-4877-84be-635b864b9069", "import_id": null, "last_action": "submitted", "bulk_created": false, "task": 144951444, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60833, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": 60833}], "file_upload": "2d869759-batch_5_data.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "agreement": 100.0, "data": {"_id": {"$oid": "67720c7a351814a79e981146"}, "text": "A pastor briefly lost his cool after police investigators interrogated him for allegedly abusing eight children in his home.\\n\\nKeith Lynn Holt, 58, of the city of Blackwell’s House of Prayer muttered to himself, leaned back in his chair, sighed, and crossed his legs in obvious frustration.\\n\\n“Wife turned against me.

case of a man allegedly abused by a former Catholic priest at Mater Dei High School decades ago is not the only such case involving the school, according to the law firm representing the victim.\\n\\nAttorneys on the case held a news conference outside of Christ Cathedral in Garden Grove on Wednesday where the lawsuit against Michael Harris, a onetime Mater Dei administrator, was presented as one piece of a predatory puzzle at the private Catholic school overseen by the Diocese of Orange.\\n\\nAttorney Mike Reck said there are two more cases involving Mater Dei High School that are set to go to trial next year as “bellwether” cases that could help predict the outcome of other similar lawsuits.\\n\\n“More of these trials are coming,” he said. “They’re coming because survivors are tired and because the survivors deserve it.”\\n\\nThe settlement with the Diocese of Orange came just days before a jury was set to be selected for a trial at the Orange County Superior Court’s North Justice Center in Fullerton.\\n\\n“For decades, the bishop and the administrators at Mater Dei have allowed Harris and 17 other known offenders … to prosper, to teach, to build trust and then prey on kids,” attorney Jeff Anderson said at the press conference. “Today is not only just to sound the alarm about the peril that has long existed but to do something to require Mater Dei and the Diocese of Orange to clean it up and to come clean.”\\n\\nThe alleged victim in the suit remained anonymous and did not appear at the news conference, but an attorney read a statement on his behalf.\\n\\n“Harris, Mater Dei and the Diocese of Orange made promises to me and promises to my parents,” his statement read. “They promised that I would be safe at school. They also promised I would be part of a community, a community that would help me grow as a student, as a Catholic, as a human, and instead, they put me in path of a serial predator.”\\n\\nThe alleged incident was said to have happened at Mater Dei High School in 1978, when the man was 15.\\n\\nAccording to the lawsuit, Harris allegedly summoned the student to his office to tell him his “grades were too poor to continue his education” at Mater Dei High School. The victim became distraught knowing how hard his mother had worked to get him enrolled.\\n\\nThe lawsuit claims Harris, who worked as a vice principal at the time, consoled the student before forcefully performing oral copulation during the encounter.\\n\\nIn a statement of their own, the Diocese of Orange said it was prepared to take the case to trial.\\n\\n“All parties — the plaintiff, the Diocese’s insurers and the Diocese — agreed that a pretrial settlement was most beneficial to everyone involved,” said Jarryd Gonzales, a Diocese of Orange spokesperson.\\n\\nThe Catholic Church has paid out at least $10 million in civil cases involving Harris, who has never been criminally charged.\\n\\nA $5.2-million settlement reached in 2001 was believed to be the largest publicly disclosed payment by the Catholic Church to a victim in a sex abuse lawsuit at that time.\\n\\nJeff Anderson and Associates represents seven cases involving the former priest, who was laicized in 2003, as well as eight Mater Dei High School cases.\\n\\nAccording to court documents, the Archdiocese of Los Angeles listed Harris in its “Report to the People of God” in 2004. The suit alleges that the report tallied 12 accusers against him between 1972 and 1990.\\n\\nAttorneys claimed that in the course of working on the Harris case, new details were discovered that were “absolutely shocking.”\\n\\n“By the time he got to Mater Dei High School in 1975, he had already abused nine other students that we are aware of,” claimed attorney Neda Lofti. “Harris should have never gotten to Mater Dei High School.”\\n\\nLofti also claimed that new information was uncovered about other alleged sex abuse perpetrators at Mater Dei, including those hired by Harris himself.\\n\\nGabriel San Román is a feature writer for TimesOC.

As hundreds of thousands were released into the U.S., including TdA members, violence spread nationwide, including in the so-called sanctuary city of Chicago.\\n\\nTren de Aragua gang members are known for violence, murder, kidnapping, extortion, bribery and human and drug trafficking and are linked to more than 100 law enforcement investigations nationwide.\\n\\nAn investigation by America First Legal found that Chicago law enforcement learned that TdA members were perpetrating human trafficking, sex exploitation, drug trafficking, and retail theft rings, also using extreme brutality – including dismemberment – to threaten their rivals.\\n\\nTdA members have embedded themselves in South American migrant communities, with Chicago Police Department records revealing at least 30 arrests were of confirmed TdA members between Jan. 1, 2023, and Sept. 10, 2024, according to records obtained by AFL through Freedom of Information requests.\\n\\nIn October, AFL released its first report on TdA crime impacting Cook County, publishing records from the Cook County Sheriff’s Office. In November, it published data and documents from the Chicago Police Department and Illinois Governor’s Office related to TdA crime and city policies.\\n\\nAccording to police arrest records obtained by CWB Chicago News, arrests of Venezuelan nationals in Chicago exploded by more than 2,500% under the Biden administration between 2021 and 2023. Chicago Police Department officers arrested six Venezuelan nationals in 2021, 26 in 2022 and 686 in 2023, according to the data. Venezuelan arrests in 2023 were up 11,333% from 2021 and up 2,538% from 2022, the outlet reported.\\n\\nTdA crime doesn’t just stay in Chicago but has been found to be linked to multiple cities. Last month, an alleged TdA member operating in Chicago was arrested in Chattanooga, Tenn. in a sex trafficking crackdown, NBC 5 News Chicago reported.\\n\\nThis is after he illegally entered the U.S. in Eagle Pass, Texas, in July 2022, was processed for removal and released into the country instead of being detained, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. By February 2024, he was arrested by Cicero, Ill., police officers on multiple charges including aggravated unlawful use of a weapon, and subsequently released. In March, ICE arrested and detained him, nearly two years after ICE first released him into the country.\\n\\nIn Indiana, Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department detectives busted a sex trafficking ring connected to TdA members allegedly engaged in forced prostitution with ties to a sex trafficking ring in Boston, Mass., authorities said, WTHR News reported.\\n\\nTdA members were also arrested in Missouri, prompting state and federal lawmakers to demand answers and introduce legislation, The Center Square exclusively reported.\\n\\nIn Wisconsin, a confirmed TdA member was arrested in Crawford County late last year on six charges including strangulation, false imprisonment, sexual assault and child abuse, WXOW News 19 reported.\\n\\nSome reports by think tanks and on social media appear to confuse TdA with South American theft groups (SATG) operating in the Midwest. The SATG are primarily run by Columbian and Chilean nationals who either illegally entered the U.S. or exploited a visa program, The Center Square reported. Those targeting NFL and NBA players in Michigan and Minnesota have been confirmed to be part of the SATG, The Center Square reported.\\n\\nAlthough TdA has established a stronghold in Colombia, Chile and Peru, authorities have yet to confirm TdA affiliation when making SATG announcements. Many of these cases are ongoing and SATG culprits remain at large.\\n\\nThe type of crimes and methodology used by the groups are different, authorities have found. SATG operatives target wealthy neighborhoods, burglarize homes and quickly leave the scene.

The email address associated with the account was “pedvid7@gmail.com.” On December 12, 2023, law enforcement obtained a state search warrant allowing them to search the account associated with pedvid7@gmail.com. In that account, law enforcement discovered approximately 249 videos of CSAM.\\n\\nOn January 9, 2024, law enforcement obtained a state residential search warrant for the address associated with email address and the online storage account. Present at the address was McDaniel. A cell phone was recovered from under the mattress in McDaniel’s room. McDaniel was interviewed. He admitted that the cell phone found belonged to him, and he admitted hiding it when he heard law enforcement enter the residence. A forensic examination was performed on McDaniel’s cell phone. The examiner discovered evidence that McDaniel had used email addresses pedvid1, pedvid2, pedvid3, etc., up through pedvid15@gmail.com. There were approximately 25 images of CSAM found on the phone. Importantly, there were 7 images that appeared be taken via a hidden camera in a bathroom, in front of a shower. The images show two different minor females drying off and getting dressed. The minors were identified, and were 13 years old at the time of the recording.\\n\\nMcDaniel's plea agreement states he will serve a 360-month sentence of incarceration and a 15-year term of supervised release upon his future release. During his term of imprisonment, McDaniel will undergo sex offender treatment, substance abuse testing and treatment, and mental health treatment. He will be required to register as a sex offender and is prohibited from having contact with minors. McDaniel has been ordered to pay $200 in special assessments and $1,337 in restitution to his victims.\\n\\nShare Your Thoughts Below, Alabama\\n\\nYour input is always appreciated.\\n\\nPlease be sure to like, share, follow, and comment if you enjoy articles like these.

The lawsuit, filed July 24, accuses St. Louis church officials of covering up abuse by clergy and staff for decades. Dozens of plaintiffs are listed on the suit, including one Ralph Wehner.\\n\\nBut even after the investigation has closed, the diocese has still not confirmed or denied whether the man accused of sex abuse is the same man working in Kansas City.\\n\\nOne plaintiff, W.C., alleged that “Brother Ralph Wehner” had groped and fondled him at least three times when W.C. was a teenager. The plaintiff’s attorney, Todd Mathews, said in an email earlier this month that W.C. voluntarily dismissed the claim for personal reasons, but no other information was available.\\n\\nMathews said he appreciates the public respecting the survivor’s privacy in the matter.\\n\\n“We look forward to continuing to vigorously represent all of those survivors who have suffered horrific sexual abuse by vicious predators,” Mathews said in an email.\\n\\nAshlie Hand, a spokeswoman with the Diocese, said in an email that an independent review board did not establish whether the Ralph Wehner accused in the St. Louis lawsuit is the same man working at Our Lady of Good Counsel.\\n\\nThe investigation did not turn up evidence disputing the claim either, she said.\\n\\nBut in August, Hand said the diocese in Kansas City was “able to identify enough additional details to make a potential connection to Dcn. Ralph Wehner.”\\n\\nThe Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph said in a statement Thursday that it made every effort to conduct a thorough investigation, but found no information corroborating the accusation.\\n\\nHand also said no parishioners have shared concerns about Wehner throughout the course of the investigation.\\n\\n“Bishop Johnston has lifted the precautionary suspension from exercising diaconal ministry and restored Deacon Ralph Wehner to active ministry,” the Diocese said in the statement.\\n\\nHand said the investigator was unable to gather any additional evidence or information prior to the complainant dropping his lawsuit earlier this month.\\n\\nHand told The Star in a Dec. 4 email that the claimant was unwilling to cooperate with the Diocese’s investigation.\\n\\n“The complainant has been unresponsive to our requests through legal counsel to participate in our investigation into the accusations,” Hand said in an email.\\n\\nOur Lady of Good Counsel’s website says Wehner originally hails from St. Louis and came to the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph in 2009.\\n\\nDavid Clohessy, the Missouri director of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, has called on the diocese to be transparent with church members throughout its investigation into the sex abuse claim.\\n\\nClohessy said that Missouri Catholic officials should have been able to determine if the Kansas City deacon is the same man who was accused in St. Louis.\\n\\n“Kansas City’s bishop refuses to even confirm or deny that his deacon is the same cleric who is accused of abusing a St. Louis boy,” Clohessy said in an email. “That hurts families and insults parishioners.”\\n\\nThe Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph said in the statement about Wehner’s return that it is committed to investing time and resources to “stop the abuse of minors, prevent future abuse and foster healing for survivors and their families.”\\n\\n“Since 2002, 41,000 adults working or volunteering with the Church in our diocese have been trained in how to recognize and report child sexual abuse, establishing a strong culture of prevention,” the statement reads.\\n\\nThe diocese said it takes all allegations of misconduct by church personnel seriously and works to respond to survivors’ needs with urgency, respect and compassion.\\n\\n“We encourage anyone with knowledge about any misconduct by a church volunteer, employee, religious or clergy member — regardless of when the abuse may have occurred — to contact civil authorities first, and then call or text the diocese’s confidential report line 816-812-2500 or email ombudsman@diocesekcsj.org,” the diocese said in the statement.\\n\\nKendrick Calfee covers breaking news for The Kansas City Star with a focus on public safety.

She was shaken by what we found, deeply compassionate toward survivors and willing to look unflinchingly at an ugliness that many avert their eyes from.\\n\\nThe villains then were easy to spot: brutes who raped, sold and enslaved underage girls. In the real world, it’s more complicated. Predators can hold glamorous jobs, present themselves as feminists and be celebrated for their roles empowering women.\\n\\nThat’s the situation Lively describes in an explosive legal complaint that she filed recently against Wayfarer Studios, maker of her recent film “It Ends With Us.” She alleges that after she protested sexual harassment by Justin Baldoni, her co-star and the film’s director, the studio retaliated with a PR smear campaign against her. Lively also names Baldoni and several public relations experts in the suit.\\n\\nIronies abound. The film is in part about how men get away with mistreating women around them. As my New York Times colleagues noted in a must-read article, Baldoni was honored this month at an event heralding men who “elevate women” and “promote gender equality.” And he reportedly has described himself as a feminist and has said things like, “Let’s just shut up and finally listen to the women in our lives.”\\n\\nSo, with the caveat that the complaint presents just one side, let’s listen.\\n\\nIs anyone safe?\\n\\nLively alleges that Baldoni added sexual content and gratuitous nude scenes to the film and treated women disrespectfully. During a childbirth scene, the filing says, the studio allowed “nonessential crew to pass through while Ms. Lively was mostly nude with her legs spread wide in stirrups and only a small piece of fabric covering her genitalia.” Among the nonessential people who showed up, she says, was a Wayfarer co-chair.\\n\\n“Ms. Lively became even more alarmed when Mr. Baldoni introduced his ‘best friend’ to play the role of the OB-GYN,” the complaint states. It adds that “the selection of Mr. Baldoni’s friend for this intimate role, in which the actor’s face and hands were in close proximity to her nearly nude genitalia for a birth scene, was invasive and humiliating.”\\n\\nLively’s complaint says that executives entered her trailer uninvited when she was undressed, ogled her when she was topless, asked intimate questions and commented inappropriately on various women involved in the film.\\n\\nText messages and emails obtained by Lively’s lawyers through a subpoena suggest that Wayfarer organized a social media campaign to preemptively discredit her, for fear that she would speak up about her claims. “We can bury anyone,” boasted a crisis management expert hired by the studio, in an exchange about her.\\n\\nWayfarer and Baldoni strongly deny the allegations. “It is shameful that Ms. Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations,” a lawyer for the studio said in a statement to the Times. After she raised initial concerns, Wayfarer agreed to provide an intimacy coordinator and added other safeguards.\\n\\nWhat is clear is that Lively faced a surge of online negativity last summer, with The Daily Mail asking if she was about to be canceled and suggesting that her star might be forever tarnished. Sales of her hair care products fell.\\n\\nEven in an age when wild lies and deepfakes catch fire on social media, it’s a little scary to think that a few PR professionals could manage to undercut one of America’s best-known celebrities so successfully, swiftly and effortlessly. If “social manipulation,” as the internal messages referred to the apparent campaign, can damage a famous person like Lively, is anyone safe? As one of the people hired by Wayfarer put it, “People really want to hate on women.”\\n\\nOnly way forward\\n\\nI suspect that the last thing Lively wants is for us to be discussing people leering at her while she was naked. This suit prolongs the humiliation. But the only way to end impunity is to speak up.\\n\\nIn a very different context, in France, Gisèle Pelicot spoke out after her husband arranged for dozens of men to rape her while she was drugged. “The shame must change sides,” she said, and of course, she was right: The shame lies with the rapists, not with their targets. And while what Lively faced is not the same, it’s also true that on a movie set or anywhere else, the stigma and humiliation should fall on the abusers, not the abused. That’s the only way forward, and it happens when people step forward and file suits with painful details.\\n\\nWe don’t know all that happened on the set of “It Ends With Us,” and Baldoni and the studio executives have a right to be heard. More will emerge as this case proceeds.\\n\\nThe online campaign against Lively suggested that she was a diva and difficult to work with. All I know is that during the collaboration with Lively on the documentary, “A Path Appears,” by Show of Force, I found her authentic, delightful and committed. She wanted to use her stardom to help others who needed the attention more, such as survivors of human trafficking. She wanted to use her celebrity to help chip away at misogyny and oppression.\\n\\nShe was particularly moved by the courage of women who shared harrowing accounts of being trafficked. “I just have so much admiration and respect for these women, for opening up and telling their stories,” Lively said at the time. “Because it makes me think, if that happened to me, would I have the courage?”\\n\\nThen she said something that shapes how I see her in this moment.

Jind district, which is commonly known as heartland of the state, has been considered one of the most backward districts of Haryana following lack of industrial development, education, employment, health and in other sectors.There were reported 50 child marriages in 2015-16 subsequently 57 in 2016-17 and 48 in 2017-18 thereafter 42 in 2018-19 and 19 in 2019-20 led to a significant decline. Subsequently, 50 marriages were reported in 2020-21 during the Corona outbreak and 16 in 2021-22 thereafter 18 in 2022-23 followed by 12 in 2023-24 and 11 in 2024-25.The report highlights a significant drop in the number of underage marriages, showcasing the success of sustained awareness campaigns carried out by NGOs and stricter enforcement of laws. Compared to a decade ago, the region now reports a marked improvement in adherence to legal marriageable age norms, signalling a shift in societal attitudes.Surender Mann, state coordinator of an NGO named mission to the desperate and destitute of India, whose team also working on grounds attributes this decline to several factors, including increased educational opportunities for girls, enhanced community engagement, and government initiatives.Collective efforts of teams have played a crucial role in discouraging early marriages through targeted interventions. We need continued efforts to eradicate the practice completely and to address other associated issues such as child labour and school dropouts, he said.Narender Sharma, working as district coordinator, stated that numbers reflect a significant change in mindset. \"Parents are now prioritizing education over marriage for their daughters, which is a welcome transformation. Our teams are approaching parents directly and asking them to fill out an oath certificate for not solemnising the early marriages of their daughters. Initially, we have identified such 50 villages where efforts are on with the help of village sarpanch, khap leader and parents to prevent child marriages. Moreover, Girls had a chance to pursue their studies after Chaudhary Ranbir Singh University was set up in 2014 in Jind district which led to a change in the mindset of parents. There are around 5,000 students in CRSU and girls contribute to 80 percent of the total students which shows that they are now moving toward higher education rather than solemnising marriage at an early age,” he said.Sources said that girls too have become aware and, in many cases, they are secretly informing officials directly through helpline numbers to stop their marriages following further study and career. Such cases are being reported from families which hail from humble backgrounds but they too are becoming aware now gradually, said a member associated with these teams.A team member said that female sarpanches are also playing a positive role in stopping marriages and teams are making contact with them constantly to impose a ban at the root level.Samunder Phour, spokesperson of Jind-based Majra khap, one of the prominent khaps (social clan) stated that there were illiterate people heading khaps but now educated people have entered social clans. Khap leaders’ mindset also have changed and they are in favour of girl child education rather than their marriages an early age. Khaps are invoking and stressing more on girl education now, he added.Sunita Sharma, district child marriage prohibition officer deputed in Jind district stated that efforts are on to curb the menace and it is the outcome of collective efforts of different teams.While the progress is commendable, “. The decline in child marriages in Khapland district stands as a testament to the power of awareness, education, and collective action in bringing about social change, said Mohammad Imran Raza, deputy commissioner of Jind district."}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.714033Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-04T15:36:50.002238Z", "inner_id": 158, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60834, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 144951453, "annotations": [{"id": 53852143, "completed_by": {"id": 60834, "email": "ankitamanna1@gmail.com", "first_name": "", "last_name": ""}, "result": [{"id": "K21WVxgy8v", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Incident"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}, {"id": "IfcXzs9p_r", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Minor", "Sexual Abuse"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "coercion_classifier"}, {"id": "EjByX-krWB", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "recruitment_classifier"}, {"id": "D9pHNSClgr", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "transport_classifier"}, {"id": "qhm0qCMVmW", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Child Sexual Exploitation"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_classifier"}, {"id": "rF2jpV708x", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_sub_classifier"}], "reviews": [], "history": [{"id": 58944133, "comment": null, "organization_id": 34950, "project_id": 122257, "annotation_id": 53852143, "draft_id": null, "review_id": null, "task_id": 144951453, "result": [{"id": "K21WVxgy8v", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Incident"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}, {"id": "IfcXzs9p_r", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Minor", "Sexual Abuse"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "coercion_classifier"}, {"id": "EjByX-krWB", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "recruitment_classifier"}, {"id": "D9pHNSClgr", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "transport_classifier"}, {"id": "qhm0qCMVmW", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Child Sexual Exploitation"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_classifier"}, {"id": "rF2jpV708x", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_sub_classifier"}], "lead_time": 338.355, "action": "submitted", "started_at": "2025-02-04T15:37:24.683000Z", "created_at": "2025-02-04T15:43:02.756637Z", "created_by": 60834, "comment_id": null}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-04T15:43:02.626727Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-04T15:43:02.626739Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-02-04T15:39:28.826868Z", "lead_time": 338.355, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 6, "unique_id": "ca64c224-8f88-438f-b9ea-1f2885191aef", "import_id": null, "last_action": "submitted", "bulk_created": false, "task": 144951453, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60834, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": 60834}], "file_upload": "2d869759-batch_5_data.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "agreement": 100.0, "data": {"_id": {"$oid": "67720c7a351814a79e981129"}, "text": "BOSTON, MA - An illegal alien facing criminal charges related to the sexual exploitation of children has been arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement after a Massachusetts court cleared him release from jail- in defiance of a request from ICE to transfer him to federal custody.Hugo Israel Ruiz, 55, was apprehended by ICE earlier this month after bailing out of the Nashua Street Jail in Boston, according to Fox News . Ruiz is facing felony charges of indecent assault and battery on a child under the age of 14.After Ruiz's initial arrest in August, the Chelsea District Court approved his bail- defying the request from ICE to transfer him into immigration custody.Subsequently, Ruiz was released into the community, pending the adjudication of his child sex crimes charges. The exact circumstances of Ruiz's release aren't clear- it's uncertain if the jail willfully ignored ICE's request to detain the accused pedophile, or if the county failed to account for the federal interest in Ruiz's continued detention.It's also unclear for how long Ruiz was allowed to walk the streets of the community before his immigration arrest.With Ruiz's federal arrest, he stands to face deportation after his sex crimes charges are resolved.ERO Boston acting Field Office Director Patricia H.

She was shaken by what we found, deeply compassionate toward survivors and willing to look unflinchingly at an ugliness that many avert their eyes from.\\n\\nThe villains then were easy to spot: brutes who raped, sold and enslaved underage girls. In the real world, it’s more complicated. Predators can hold glamorous jobs, present themselves as feminists and be celebrated for their roles empowering women.\\n\\nThat’s the situation Lively describes in an explosive legal complaint that she filed recently against Wayfarer Studios, maker of her recent film “It Ends With Us.” She alleges that after she protested sexual harassment by Justin Baldoni, her co-star and the film’s director, the studio retaliated with a PR smear campaign against her. Lively also names Baldoni and several public relations experts in the suit.\\n\\nIronies abound. The film is in part about how men get away with mistreating women around them. As my New York Times colleagues noted in a must-read article, Baldoni was honored this month at an event heralding men who “elevate women” and “promote gender equality.” And he reportedly has described himself as a feminist and has said things like, “Let’s just shut up and finally listen to the women in our lives.”\\n\\nSo, with the caveat that the complaint presents just one side, let’s listen.\\n\\nIs anyone safe?\\n\\nLively alleges that Baldoni added sexual content and gratuitous nude scenes to the film and treated women disrespectfully. During a childbirth scene, the filing says, the studio allowed “nonessential crew to pass through while Ms. Lively was mostly nude with her legs spread wide in stirrups and only a small piece of fabric covering her genitalia.” Among the nonessential people who showed up, she says, was a Wayfarer co-chair.\\n\\n“Ms. Lively became even more alarmed when Mr. Baldoni introduced his ‘best friend’ to play the role of the OB-GYN,” the complaint states. It adds that “the selection of Mr. Baldoni’s friend for this intimate role, in which the actor’s face and hands were in close proximity to her nearly nude genitalia for a birth scene, was invasive and humiliating.”\\n\\nLively’s complaint says that executives entered her trailer uninvited when she was undressed, ogled her when she was topless, asked intimate questions and commented inappropriately on various women involved in the film.\\n\\nText messages and emails obtained by Lively’s lawyers through a subpoena suggest that Wayfarer organized a social media campaign to preemptively discredit her, for fear that she would speak up about her claims. “We can bury anyone,” boasted a crisis management expert hired by the studio, in an exchange about her.\\n\\nWayfarer and Baldoni strongly deny the allegations. “It is shameful that Ms. Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations,” a lawyer for the studio said in a statement to the Times. After she raised initial concerns, Wayfarer agreed to provide an intimacy coordinator and added other safeguards.\\n\\nWhat is clear is that Lively faced a surge of online negativity last summer, with The Daily Mail asking if she was about to be canceled and suggesting that her star might be forever tarnished. Sales of her hair care products fell.\\n\\nEven in an age when wild lies and deepfakes catch fire on social media, it’s a little scary to think that a few PR professionals could manage to undercut one of America’s best-known celebrities so successfully, swiftly and effortlessly. If “social manipulation,” as the internal messages referred to the apparent campaign, can damage a famous person like Lively, is anyone safe? As one of the people hired by Wayfarer put it, “People really want to hate on women.”\\n\\nOnly way forward\\n\\nI suspect that the last thing Lively wants is for us to be discussing people leering at her while she was naked. This suit prolongs the humiliation. But the only way to end impunity is to speak up.\\n\\nIn a very different context, in France, Gisèle Pelicot spoke out after her husband arranged for dozens of men to rape her while she was drugged. “The shame must change sides,” she said, and of course, she was right: The shame lies with the rapists, not with their targets. And while what Lively faced is not the same, it’s also true that on a movie set or anywhere else, the stigma and humiliation should fall on the abusers, not the abused. That’s the only way forward, and it happens when people step forward and file suits with painful details.\\n\\nWe don’t know all that happened on the set of “It Ends With Us,” and Baldoni and the studio executives have a right to be heard. More will emerge as this case proceeds.\\n\\nRelated Articles\\n\\nOpinion Columnists | Federal closure of scandal-plagued FCI Dublin women’s prison will be permanent Opinion Columnists | Diocese of Oakland proposes $117 million-plus fund in clergy sex abuse deal; victims’ attorneys call it ‘a scam and a sham’ Opinion Columnists | Hero policewoman sues department over Gilroy Garlic Festival shooting injury, alleged sex discrimination Opinion Columnists | Richmond man accused of rape, kidnapping and sexual battery Opinion Columnists | All the major legal battles Elon Musk and his companies are facing\\n\\nThe online campaign against Lively suggested that she was a diva and difficult to work with. All I know is that during the collaboration with Lively on the documentary, “A Path Appears,” by Show of Force, I found her authentic, delightful and committed. She wanted to use her stardom to help others who needed the attention more, such as survivors of human trafficking. She wanted to use her celebrity to help chip away at misogyny and oppression.\\n\\nShe was particularly moved by the courage of women who shared harrowing accounts of being trafficked. “I just have so much admiration and respect for these women, for opening up and telling their stories,” Lively said at the time. “Because it makes me think, if that happened to me, would I have the courage?”\\n\\nThen she said something that shapes how I see her in this moment. Speaking of the trafficking survivors we met, Lively said: “They don’t want to hear, ‘You’re so inspirational,’ because that implies you’re a victim. It’s like, ‘I don’t want to be an inspiration.

Among these cases, a 13-year-old girl gave birth at Seshego Hospital, leading to the arrest of a 28-year-old man on charges of statutory rape. ￼\\n\\nMandatory Reporting Obligations\\n\\nSouth African law mandates that healthcare workers report instances of sexual activity involving minors under the age of 16, as these constitute statutory rape regardless of consent. The Children’s Act and the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act require professionals to report such cases to authorities. Failure to do so may result in legal consequences for the professionals involved. ￼\\n\\nPremier Ramathuba’s Stance\\n\\nPremier Ramathuba emphasized that patient-doctor confidentiality does not supersede the legal duty to report child abuse and statutory rape. She warned that healthcare workers who neglect this responsibility could face criminal charges. “When you are attending to a pregnant minor and you have acquired that information as a doctor, the Child Protection Act and the constitution of the republic supersede that of the health professional council,” she stated.\\n\\nRecent Incident and Arrest\\n\\nThe arrest of the 28-year-old man accused of impregnating the 13-year-old girl underscores the importance of vigilance and adherence to reporting protocols. The suspect is expected to appear in court soon. Premier Ramathuba has dispatched the MECs for Health, Social Development, and Transport and Community Safety to ensure the young mother receives the necessary support during this challenging time.\\n\\nRising Concern Over Teenage Pregnancies\\n\\nThe province has witnessed a concerning increase in teenage pregnancies. On Christmas Day alone, 31 teenagers gave birth in Limpopo public hospitals. This trend highlights the need for comprehensive interventions to address the underlying causes, including education on sexual health and stricter enforcement of laws protecting minors. ￼\\n\\nLegal Framework and Healthcare Professionals’ Duties\\n\\nThe Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act defines statutory rape as engaging in sexual activities with individuals under the age of 16, irrespective of consent. Healthcare professionals are legally obligated to report any suspicions of such activities to the police or designated social workers. Non-compliance can lead to legal repercussions, including charges of obstructing justice or being complicit in the abuse. ￼\\n\\nLimpopo Premier Dr. Phophi Ramathuba\\n\\n🔴Central News Weekly Edition 087🔴 Download the Latest Edition | Top Story: “Building ‘The Ngwathe We Want’:\\n\\nDr Mothamaha Drives Cost-Effective\\n\\nSolutions with New Fleet Acquisitions”\\n\\nDownload Here:\\n\\nRead all our publications on magzter:\\n\\nhttps://www.magzter.com/ZA/Central-News-Pty-Ltd/Central-News/Newspaper/All-Issues\\n\\nCentral News also offers Sponsored Editorial Content, Podcasts , Radio / Social Media Simulcast, Video Production , Live Streaming Services, Press Conferences, and Paid Interviews (Video/Audio) etc.\\n\\nWe guarantee exceptional exposure, reach, and engagement, with an excellent return on investment.\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\nTo place your advert on our platforms (Print Newspaper or Digital Platforms) : Please email : sales@centralnews.co.za\\n\\nFor Business Related:\\n\\nbusiness@centralnews.co.za\\n\\nNewsroom:\\n\\nSend your Stories / Media Statements To: newsroom@centralnews.co.za\\n\\nGeneral Info:\\n\\ninfo@centralnews.co.za\\n\\nOffice Administrator:\\n\\nadmin@centralnews.co.za\\n\\nWhatsapp / Call: 081 495 5487\\n\\nWebsite: https://www.centralnews.co.za\\n\\nSocial Media Platforms (@centralnewsza) : Linkedin, Facebook, Tiktok, Twitter, Instagram, Youtube\\n\\ncentralnewsza #news #politics #business"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.714085Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-04T16:16:55.343619Z", "inner_id": 161, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60834, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 144951456, "annotations": [{"id": 53855071, "completed_by": {"id": 60834, "email": "ankitamanna1@gmail.com", "first_name": "", "last_name": ""}, "result": [{"id": "vtPouQR8fJ", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Incident"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}, {"id": "p7TDncN_OF", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Minor", "Physical Abuse/Threat or force"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "coercion_classifier"}, {"id": "c7CnZVsda5", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Child Sexual Exploitation"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_classifier"}, {"id": "U8oVPvxMid", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "transport_classifier"}, {"id": "zToi5hBx2Y", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_sub_classifier"}], "reviews": [], "history": [{"id": 58947338, "comment": null, "organization_id": 34950, "project_id": 122257, "annotation_id": 53855071, "draft_id": null, "review_id": null, "task_id": 144951456, "result": [{"id": "vtPouQR8fJ", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Incident"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}, {"id": "p7TDncN_OF", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Minor", "Physical Abuse/Threat or force"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "coercion_classifier"}, {"id": "c7CnZVsda5", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Child Sexual Exploitation"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_classifier"}, {"id": "U8oVPvxMid", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "transport_classifier"}, {"id": "zToi5hBx2Y", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_sub_classifier"}], "lead_time": 263.536, "action": "submitted", "started_at": "2025-02-04T16:16:56.490000Z", "created_at": "2025-02-04T16:21:19.736820Z", "created_by": 60834, "comment_id": null}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-04T16:21:19.625964Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-04T16:21:19.625972Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-02-04T16:18:36.901918Z", "lead_time": 263.536, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 5, "unique_id": "a4510511-ee99-4bad-b867-6ef45825bdba", "import_id": null, "last_action": "submitted", "bulk_created": false, "task": 144951456, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60834, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": 60834}], "file_upload": "2d869759-batch_5_data.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "agreement": 100.0, "data": {"_id": {"$oid": "67720c7a351814a79e981109"}, "text": "Seven-Year-Old\\n\\nA seven-year-old child is in critical condition after allegedly being assaulted by their stepfather on a farm in oThongathi, north of Durban.

(DC)\\n\\nBaptist Press [Nashville TN]\\n\\n\\n\\nDecember 26, 2024\\n\\nBy Mallory Challis\\n\\nA week before Christmas, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Stop Institutional Child Abuse Act in a bipartisan — and nearly unanimous — vote of 373-33. Earlier in the week, the Senate passed the bill unanimously, and President Joe Biden signed it into law Dec. 23.\\n\\nThe bill aims to reform the troubled teen industry, which receives millions of dollars in revenue from government funds each year but lacks federal oversight. Many youth are placed in these facilities against their will, sometimes being kidnapped by employees with a parent’s consent, and subjected to behavior modification regimes in attempts to improve “whatever parents may deem wrong with their teenage kids.”\\n\\nRather than utilizing clinically based or trauma-informed care, these institutions typically employ abusive methods of control and torture against teens, including restricted access to food, sexual abuse, emotional manipulation and restricted access to communication with anyone outside the facility. In turn, these institutions are advertised to parents as helpful, peaceful and rehabilitative environments for their children, and without direct communication with their children are unaware the abuse is happening at all.\\n\\nAdvocates have attempted to list and count the number of teens who have died at these facilities, such as this list titled “1,000 places you don’t want to be as a teenager.” But due to the lack of federal oversight, the cause of many deaths, as well as the true number of deaths, at such facilities is unknown.\\n\\n“Let’s show the world that we believe every child matters. That their lives and well-being matter.”\\n\\nThe Stop Institutional Child Abuse Act was heavily endorsed by heiress, model, actor, DJ and longtime advocate Paris Hilton, who is a survivor of institutional child abuse herself. During her teenage years, she spent time at multiple rehab and residential facilities where she faced various forms of physical, psychological and sexual abuse. As an adult, she has been an advocate for youth in residential facilities, working with lawmakers to make treatment centers safer for teenagers.\\n\\nPrior to the bill’s passage, she gave a speech in Washington, D.C., urging the House to support the bill. Recalling her own experience and the abuse she suffered decades ago, she explained that still today more than 200,000 “foster youth and kids with disabilities are being traumatized in the name of treatment” and more than 20 kids died since she began working on this legislation.\\n\\nCiting her relationship with her son as a key motivating factor, she questioned why anyone would want to abuse a child. “Let’s show the world that we believe every child matters. That their lives and well-being matter,” she said.\\n\\nAfter hearing news that the bill passed, she wrote on her Instagram page: “This moment is proof that our voices matter, that speaking out can spark change and that no child should ever endure the horrors of abuse in silence. I did this for the younger version of myself and the youth who were senselessly taken from us by the Troubled Teen Industry.”\\n\\nAs federal law now, the Department of Health and Human Services is required to contract with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine to conduct studies on youth residential programs. The study must “identify the nature, prevalence, severity and scope of child abuse, neglect and deaths” in these institutions.\\n\\nThe law also requires the National Academies work with various partners to ensure as much knowledge about the troubled teen industry is uncovered as possible, such as experts in child abuse and neglect, educational professionals and survivors of abuse in youth residential programs.\\n\\nAfter 10 years of research, the report will be made public and include a comprehensive review of researchers’ findings.\\n\\nRelated articles:\\n\\nThe Troubled Teen

abortion attempts leading to mortality, as well as economic and social outcomes, exacerbated by stigmatisation, school dropout and isolation from family.2 Complications from teenage pregnancy and childbirth are the leading cause of death in girls aged 15–19 years worldwide.3 The incidence of teenage pregnancy is increasing and has become a worldwide concern. It is estimated that about 16 million girls 15–19 years old give birth each year, contributing to nearly 11% of all births worldwide.1 Globally, in 2022, an estimated 13% of adolescent girls and young women gave birth before the age of 184 5 In Africa, more than 20% of women aged 15–19 have given birth to at least one child.1 Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is home to more than one million teenage girls with pregnancy.5 SSA additionally experiences some of the highest rates of gender inequality in the world, resulting in unequal access to education and high rates of violence against girls, early pregnancy and child marriage.6 It is estimated that 608 000 girls are thought to be at risk of child marriage and 542 000 additional girls are at risk of early pregnancy.7 The regional teenage birth rate in SSA is more than double the global average, with 101 births per 1000 girls aged 15–19; ranging from 39 births per 1000 girls aged 15–19 in Rwanda to 184 births per 1000 girls aged 15–19 in Nigeria.4 Child marriage is widespread in West and Central Africa, where 42% of women are married as children, and in East and Southern Africa, where child marriage affects 37% of girls.8 Despite Uganda’s commitment to ending child, early and forced marriages and teenage pregnancy by the year 2030 through co-sponsoring the 2013 and 2014 UN General Assembly and 2013 Human Rights Council resolutions on early and forced marriages,9 one in four (24%) teenage girls in Uganda report having given birth for the first time by the age of 18.10 According to UNICEF (2021) estimates, a total of 354 736 teenage pregnancies were registered in 2020 and 196 499 in the first 6 months of 2021 amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.11 The COVID-19 pandemic wreaked unprecedented havoc on children, families and communities around the globe, disrupting vital services like girl-child education and putting millions of lives at risk. The United Nations estimated that nearly 11 million primary and secondary school learners worldwide—5.2 million of whom are girls—did not return to education following school closures amidst COVID-19 due to teenage pregnancy and related outcomes.12 For the most vulnerable children, especially girls living in refugee settlements, accessing education and staying in school are hard enough. The pandemic caused additional, unanticipated disruption, compounding their vulnerability to teenage pregnancies by many folds.7 Moreover, teenage girls living in refugee settlements face challenges accessing sexual and reproductive health services, including sex education and modern contraceptive methods.13 These girls are at a significantly higher risk of early pregnancy, a situation that worsened due to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to a recent study by the Forum for African Women Educationalists (Uganda Chapter), the rate of teenage pregnancy among girls in refugee settlements rose from 3.3% to 4.1% during the pandemic. In one Palabek settlement, the proportion of refugee girls who reported being pregnant during the COVID-19 period reached 4.8%, compared with the national average of 1.8%.13 Additionally, statistics on the uptake of modern contraceptive methods among this population is unknown. Teen pregnancies in refugee and humanitarian settings are influenced by several factors including poverty, lack of education, cultural norms, etc., further driven by limited access to healthcare, lack of social support and increased risk of sexual violence.13 14 Addressing these issues requires targeted interventions that consider the unique challenges faced by teenage girls in these settings. We therefore aimed to estimate the prevalence and associated factors of teenage pregnancies in the post-COVID-19 era in Palorinya and Bidi Bidi refugee settlements of the West Nile region, northern Uganda.\\n\\nMethods Study design and rationale We conducted a community-based, cross-sectional study between March and May 2023. We followed the Strengthening The Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines to design this manuscript in order to ensure attention to detail.14 Study setting and rationale We conducted this study in Palorinya and Bidi Bidi refugee settlements of the West Nile region, northern Uganda. According to data from the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) and United Nations Higher Commissioner for Refugees, Uganda is now home to 1 622 738 refugees living in 13 refugee settlements across the country, and almost half (6) of these are in the west Nile region.15 Women and girls constitute over 80% of this population, and the settlements are arranged in blocks and zones. Palorinya refugee settlement has four zones and 9 level three health centres, meanwhile Bidi Bidi has 6 zones and 16 level three health centres. None of the refugee settlements has a higher-level health centre; however, there are several referral sites, for example, Yumbe Health Centre IV, Midigo Health Centre IV and Yumbe Regional Referral Hospital. All these facilities provide family planning services to adolescents. This setting was chosen because it hosts the biggest number of refugee settlements, proposed to provide a big pool of potential respondents for sampling. Study population, inclusion and exclusion criteria Our study targeted teenage girls living in the refugee settlements of northern Uganda. We included only respondents between 15 and 19 years old, who provided written informed consent or assent with a consent from parent/guardian, and were living in the refugee settlements before the beginning of COVID-19. Those who did not provide informed consent or assent were not included. Sample size determination We used the Kish Lisle (1965) formula for the calculation of sample size for an unknown population. At 95% CI, we used an error of 5%, alpha risk was expressed with a z score of 1.96 and a conservative assumption of a 50% population proportion was made to ensure robustness. We obtained a sample size of 385. These choices were guided by standard practices, aiming to balance precision and practicability.\\n\\nSampling method We used convenience sampling to select study participants from Bidi Bidi and Palorinya refugee settlements. Convenience sampling in our study involved selecting participants who were readily available and willing to participate in the study. We approached individuals in many community spaces, targeting various times and days to ensure diversity. The participation acceptance rate was 100%, with no declines. This method allowed us to gather data from a broad participant base. Research instruments We developed a semi-structured questionnaire including both open and closed-ended questions. The data collection tool was developed in English and translated into three languages: Acholi, Kuku and Arabic. We pretested the tool among respondents of similar characteristics outside the study area, after which we refined and fine-tuned the tool for reliability and validity. The tool was then exported into KoboToolbox installed on mobile phone devices which was used for data collection. We asked about demographics, household characteristics, pregnancy history between January 2020 and May 2023 and intentions, marriage status, modern contraceptive use between January 2020 and May 2023, sex education and sexual and physical abuse among others. Abuse was measured by asking ‘Have you ever experienced physical abuse?’ and ‘Have you ever experienced sexual abuse?’ with timeframes specified as ‘in the past 12 months’ and ‘in your lifetime,’ respectively. Contraception use was assessed by asking ‘Have you ever used any form of contraception?’. Those who had ever used were further asked to specify the method of contraception used. Peer pressure was measured by asking ‘Have you ever experienced any form of peer pressure to get pregnant?’ Alcohol consumption was assessed by asking ‘Do you take alcohol?’. These responses were recorded as binary outcomes (yes/no). The tool was developed de novo, adhering to established guidelines and drawing from relevant literature. This tool had not been previously used in this setting, and it was tailored specifically for this study. Data collection procedures A private and comfortable room was acquired and used during the process of data collection to ensure a private and confidential environment for respondents. We recruited research assistants, who were given a 1 day training for acquaintance with the tool and were taken through research ethics and good clinical practice. The research assistants carried out the collection of data. Although gender matching between participants and data collectors was not implemented, all research assistants underwent comprehensive training on ethical principles. This training highlighted the importance of maintaining privacy and confidentiality, especially when handling sensitive information related to abuse. They explained the purpose of the study to each of the respondents identified and obtained informed consent, followed by administration of the questionnaire using an electronic form stored in the KoboToolbox mobile application, which is a free open-source tool for mobile data collection. Data management The phone devices that were used to collect the data were fully charged at every moment the research team set off to collect data, and the data captured on the phone were regularly saved to avoid loss of data. We safely kept the devices under key and lock before and after data collection, and access was limited. We exported the data into STATA V.15, where analysis was done. Data analysis The prevalence of teenage pregnancy was assessed by self-reported pregnancies from January 2020 to May 2023. We conducted Pearson’s χ2 and Fisher’s exact tests for bivariate analysis. The level of statistical significance was set at p<0.05. Variables with a p value<0.2 from these tests were included in the multivariable analysis. We applied a modified Poisson regression model at the multivariable level to evaluate independent associations. The level of statistical significance was set at p<0.05. Modified Poisson regression was chosen over logistic regression because the outcome was common (ie, the prevalence rate was high), because in such cases, the OR from logistic regression can significantly overestimate the relative risk. We considered variables with p<0.2 from bivariate analysis to be included in the multivariable regression since their power of association is ≥ 80%. The research questions tested in statistical analysis were, ‘what is the prevalence of teenage pregnancies in the study population?’ and ‘what are the associated factors of teenage pregnancies in the study population?’ The data were then computed in percentages and frequencies and finally presented in figures (pie chart, bar graph) and tables. Patient and public involvement The public was involved in this study. Dissemination of findings was done to key stakeholders.\\n\\nResults Participant characteristics Table 1 summarises the general characteristics of 385 teenage girls living in refugee settlements of the West Nile region, in northern Uganda. The mean age was 17 (IQR: 15 to 18), years, and 99.5% were Christians, 316 (82.1%) had attained primary education as the highest level, 85.6% were not working, median monthly income was 0 (IQR: 0 to 1000), Uganda shillings, 56.1% did not live with both parents, 54.8% of household heads were women and 22.1% of household leads were husband/spouse. Table 1 Individual characteristics of 385 teenage girls living in Palorinya and Bidi Bidi refugee settlements of West Nile region, northern Uganda Overall, 178 (46.2%) were sexually active, the mean age of sex debut was 15.8 (SD: 1.44) years and sexual abuse was reported by 5.2% of respondents, of whom 75% were sexually abused by strangers; meanwhile, physical abuse was reported by 21.6% of respondents, 37.1% of teenage girls experienced peer pressure and alcohol consumption was reported by 8.8% of respondents. Figure 2 summarises modern contraceptive methods used by teenage girls living in refugee settlements of the West Nile region, in northern Uganda. Among the teenage girls, 13.8% had never used modern contraceptives in their lifetime, only 7.5% were currently using modern contraceptives, of whom only 13.2% reported to have ever used long term contraceptive methods and 30.2% reported to have ever used multiple methods (including long-term and short-term methods). Overall, 17.9% received contraceptive use counselling from home, and 36.1% received home sex education, while 55.1% had received sex education from school, 40.5% had received contraceptives use counselling from school and 64.7% had never been health educated on the dangers of teenage pregnancy. Figure 1 The different contraceptive methods used by teenage girls living in Palorinya and Bidi Bidi refugee settlements of West Nile region, northern Uganda (n=385; n=53). Among the respondents, 5.7% had the intention of getting pregnant in the next 12 months, whereas 52.0% had friends who were pregnant and 24.9% were married, of whom 38.5% were forced/arranged. Up to 9.8% of the respondents had ever had an abortion and 22.0% had had a caesarean section. Period prevalence of teenage pregnancy among 385 teenage girls living in Palorinya and Bidi Bidi refugee settlements of West Nile region, northern Uganda Figure 1 shows the prevalence of teenage pregnancy among 385 teenage girls living in refugee settlements of west Nile region, northern Uganda. We found out that up to 34.0% of respondents reported to have never gotten pregnant between 2020 to 2023 (CI: 29.4% to 38.9%), and the median number of pregnancies was 1, with a minimum of 1 and maximum of 3.

Predictors of teenage pregnancy among 385 teenage girls living in Palorinya and Bidi Bidi refugee settlements of West Nile region, northern Uganda Table 2 summarises the factors associated with teenage pregnancy among 385 teenage girls living in refugee settlements of west Nile region, northern Uganda. At the bivariate level, factors, such as lack of formal education (Prevalence Ratio-PR: 3.1, 95% CI: 2.64 to 3.64, p<0.001), male house hold head (PR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.72 to 3.13, p<0.001), living with a husband/spouse (PR: 5.4, 95% CI: 4.11 to 7.17, p<0.001), intention to get pregnant (PR: 1.1, 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.15, p=0.003), peer pressure (PR: 3.7, 95% CI: 2.73 to 5.05, p<0.001), being married (PR: 6.6, 95% CI: 4.95 to 8.82, p<0.001), history of contraceptive use (PR: 3.2, 95% CI: 2.55 to 3.94, p<0.001), lack of home sex education (PR: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.16 to 2.24, p=0.005), health education on dangers of teenage pregnancy (PR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.25 to 2.49, p=0.001), sexual abuse (PR: 2.7, 95% CI: 2.14 to 3.46, p<0.001), physical abuse (PR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.80 to 2.99, p<0.001) and alcohol consumption (PR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.77 to 3.03, p<0.001), were positively associated with teenage pregnancy. Table 2 Factors independently associated with teenage pregnancy among 385 teenage girls living in Palorinya and Bidi Bidi refugee settlements of West Nile region, northern Uganda We then performed modified Poisson regression on all variables that had a p value<0.2, while controlling for occupation, media exposure and living with both parents. Teenage girls with no formal education were 2.3 times more likely to be pregnant (aPR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.26 to 4.35, p=0.007) as compared with those who had a formal education, those who were living with a husband/spouse were 3.8 times more likely to be pregnant (aPR: 3.8, 95% CI: 2.51 to 5.84, p<0.001) as compared with those who lived with their parents, teenage girls who experienced peer pressure were 2.1 times more likely to be pregnant (aPR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.54 to 2.86, p<0.001) as compared with those who did not, those who had a history of contraceptive use were 1.8 times more likely to be pregnant (aPR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.31 to 2.33, p<0.001) as compared with those who did not and teenage girls who experienced sexual abuse were 1.5 times more likely to be pregnant (aPR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.07 to 1.99, p=0.018) as compared with those who did not.\\n\\nDiscussion This study reveals a high prevalence of teenage pregnancies (34.0%) among teenage girls living in refugee settlements in northern Uganda. Several factors were independently associated with teenage pregnancies in this context, including living with a spouse or husband, lack of formal education, peer pressure and inconsistent use of modern contraceptives. Additionally, 9.8% of the respondents had experienced an abortion, highlighting the potential risks of maternal morbidity and mortality in this vulnerable population. Furthermore, the study identified concerning levels of sexual abuse, with 25% of the perpetrators being relatives, emphasising the challenges faced by these girls in seeking support and justice. Notably, there is a gap in the literature on sexual and reproductive health issues in humanitarian settings in general, and teenage pregnancy statistics in similar settings is not widely studied. Our study reveals a comparatively higher prevalence of teenage pregnancy in the refugee settings of northern Uganda, way higher than that in other studies. The high prevalence of teenage pregnancy in our study could be because our study only considered teenage girls between 15 and 19 years old, meanwhile the other studies considered teenage girls between 13 and 19 years old. We found a close relationship between sexual abuse and teenage pregnancy, which was similarly observed in Malawi.16 Our study found that up to 25% of the perpetrators of sexual abuse among teenage girls are relatives. This makes it particularly hard to seek support from community and cultural leaders, necessitating the involvement of higher authorities. Several factors were independently associated with teenage pregnancies in our study. Importantly, living with a spouse/husband presented fourfold likelihood of teenage pregnancy compared with those who lived with their parents. Other studies agree with our findings.17 Moreover, we also found out that most of the child marriages in the refugee context were forced (38.5%), similarly observed in different studies.17 Forced and early/child marriage in Bidi Bidi refugee settlement and among Ugandan refugees is a complex issue driven by various factors such as poverty and economic hardship, gender norms and cultural practices, stigma and social pressure.18 Providing education and vocational training for girls, engaging community leaders and members in dialogue and strengthening and enforcing laws against child marriage can provide a legal deterrent, meanwhile offering comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services and support for survivors of child and/or forced marriages can mitigate some of the adverse effects.18 Our study also found that 9.8% of the respondents had ever had an abortion. The limitation is that our study did not explore whether this was induced or spontaneous. Furthermore, we do not know whether this abortion was in the watch of a qualified health service provider. This poses a greater risk of severe morbidity and mortality among teenage mothers in these settings. Additionally, teenage girls without a formal education stood at a 2.3 times higher risk of teenage pregnancy compared with those with at least a primary education. Similarly, another study conducted in Malawi noted an inequality in teenage pregnancy which worsened to the disadvantage of the less educated.19 Another important predictor of teenage pregnancy in our study was peer pressure. This is related to another study carried out in Kibuku district, Uganda, that pointed out that bad peer groups were an outstanding cause of teenage pregnancy among the respondents.20 ,21 Addressing the challenge of peer pressure requires a multi-sectoral collaboration, involving the Ministry of Health, and education among other ministries. Paradoxically, our study found out that teenage girls who had a history of using modern contraceptives stood at 1.8 risk of teenage pregnancies as compared with those who did not. These findings were unlike those observed in Malawi,22,13 which otherwise found that the history of contraceptive use was a protective factor. Unfortunately, our study did not distinguish between the use of long-term and short-term contraceptives, in relation to pregnancy. We observed that 13.8% of teenage girls living in refugee settlements reported having ever used a modern contraceptive method in their lifetime. Despite this, given the relatively low average age of sexual debut (15.8 years), only 7.5% were currently using modern contraceptives, with just 13.2% having ever used long-term contraceptive methods. Noting the inconsistencies in the use of modern contraceptives among the study participants makes it possible that these inconsistencies contribute to the high prevalence of teenage pregnancy in this setting. Additionally, the proportion of respondents who had ever used long-term methods is relatively low, leaving a wider window for teenage pregnancies in this setting.\\n\\nConclusions and recommendations Our study found out that about 1 in 3 adolescent girls in refugee settlement of northern Uganda experienced pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Only 1 in 13 of the adolescents was currently using modern methods of contraception. Relevant refugee authorities and government stakeholders must develop targeted strategies to address teenage pregnancy in refugee settings, which contributes to the broader issue of maternal morbidity and mortality. This includes exploring legal actions against perpetrators of sexual abuse and implementing measures to combat forced child marriages, such as forming support groups, promoting girl child education and protecting the rights of girls in refugee settlements. The Ministry of Health, in collaboration with the OPM, should implement measures to combat sexual violence against teenage girls in refugee contexts. This could include enhancing education access for girls, which not only reduces teenage pregnancy but also helps in the fight against HIV. Encouraging the uptake of long-term contraceptive methods and fostering inclusive education solutions will help lower the incidence of teenage pregnancy and address associated challenges. In as much as this study provides important insights into the sexual and reproductive health challenges faced by adolescent girls in the Bidi Bidi refugee settlement, the findings must be interpreted within the context of the study’s limitations. Future research should aim to include a larger, more diverse sample to further validate these findings and explore the broader applicability of the results.

This also follows the arrest of a 28-year-old man for alleged statutory rape of a 13-year-old who also gave birth on Christmas Day.\\n\\nA 16-year-old from the North West province and three 15-year-olds from KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) were among those who gave birth on the day. Ramathuba cautioned medical professionals that failing to report such instances could result in criminal charges being brought against them. The Children's Act's Section 110 requires teachers, physicians, nurses, social workers, police officers, and other professionals who work with children to report any suspicions of child abuse, including statutory rape or sexual abuse."}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.714150Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-04T16:30:48.345267Z", "inner_id": 165, "total_annotations": 1,

1987.\\n\\nMakhan Singh Mauji Author: Shaunna Burns Published 28th Dec 2024\\n\\n\\n\\nA man was jailed for more than 24 years last week (Friday 20 December) after admitting sexually assaulting three young victims in the 1980s.\\n\\nMakhan Singh Mauji, aged 71, of North Priors Coury in Northampton, previously entered guilty pleas four days into a trial at Cambridge Crown Court on 14 November 2024.\\n\\nFollowing a joint investigation by the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire (BCH) Major Crime Unit and the Hertfordshire Non-Recent Child Abuse Investigation Team, he was sentenced for:\\n\\nEleven counts of indecent assault\\n\\nOne count of attempted rape\\n\\nTwo counts of indecency with a child\\n\\nOne charge of indecent assault was ordered to lie on file.\\n\\nMauji was sentenced to a total of 24 years and two months in prison, subject to licence provisions.\\n\\nHe was handed a Sexual Harm Prevention Order (SHPO) as well as being placed on the Sexual Offenders’ Register for life.\\n\\nThe assaults happened in Hitchin between July 1983 and August 1987. They occurred at a number of places in the town, including at a Gurdwara.\\n\\nGurdwaras are the meeting places for Sikhs to assemble and worship. Mauji was a Granthi and used this position to abuse his victims. The court heard how he took advantage of his role to invade the lives of his victims in the Gurdwaras and in their own homes.\\n\\nThe offences involved three victims who were aged between eight and 14 years old at the time.\\n\\nDuring sentencing, Judge Hurst commented that Mauji occupied a privileged position and was welcomed into the homes of the community, but instead of having the welfare of his community at heart, Mauji saw this position through sexually predatory eyes and saw the young girls as targets for his sexual appetite.\\n\\nJudge Hurst explained that Mauji had inflicted deep, emotional scars using a significant breach of trust and his sentence will reflect the severity of his offending.\\n\\nDetective Constable Elizabeth McGrath, from the Non-Recent Child Abuse Investigation Team, said: “Firstly I just want to commend the victims for their incredible bravery to come forward and speak of their experiences of Mauji’s offending, without them Mauji would never have answered for his crimes.\\n\\n“This sentence hopefully paves the way for some closure for our victims, knowing that a sexual predator like Mauji will remain in prison for years.”\\n\\nA representative from the local Sikh community said: \"On behalf of the local Hitchin (and surrounding areas) Sikh community, we commend the judge for passing a sentence to match the severity of the crimes that this opportunistic predator admitted to committing, whilst in a position of trust as the local Granthi (priest) some 40 years ago. It is important to support one another and ensure that all communities remain vigilant and proactively call out such abhorrent behaviour, taking advantage of the vulnerable and meek. We hope that the vulnerable victims are able to have some solace and admire their extraordinary courage and strength in bringing this evil individual to justice.\"\\n\\nDetective Inspector Justine Jenkins, from the BCH Major Crime Unit, said: “We know it can be incredibly challenging to come forward to report incidents of sexual assault. We take reports of sexual offences very seriously and we will do everything we can to ensure that victims feel like their voices are heard and that offenders are brought to justice.\\n\\n“Anyone wishing to report a sexual assault will always be treated sensitively and with respect by us. We recognise how difficult it must be but please be assured we have specially trained officers who can help you every step of the way.”\\n\\nHear all the latest news from across the UK on the hour,

This is mainly steered by traditional obscurantist culture, severe poverty, and abusive feudal lords, impacting the national level of administration and limiting the ability of political forces to combat such heinous crimes.\\n\\nMore than 500 girls fall victim to forced marriages every year.\\n\\nMoreover, forced conversions in Sindh are carried out in the forms of bonded labor and forced marriages. Minorities, however, do not have enough community life to resist such crimes.\\n\\nIn this context, religious parties are essential to creating obstacles in certain legal frameworks. In 2016, religious parties threatened the Sindh Assembly to lay siege to the Sindh Assembly if the bill prohibiting forced conversions was not repealed. In 2019, the rejection of the revised bill proscribing the forced conversions was also influenced by religious parties.\\n\\nBharchundi Sharif and Sarhandi Pir are prominent religious factions, perpetuating forced conversion. Religious institutions emanate a certificate to an abductor that is credible in terms of law. Furthermore, these certificates can be used to elude trials.\\n\\nMoreover, it begs the question of how local religious parties and influentials are able to do such abhorrent acts. Numerous sources state that these parties are backed by a continuously ruling elite in Sindh. Both of the aforementioned bills were turned down by this ruling elite. Sindh’s administration always succumbs to these influentials.\\n\\nIn addition to death threats, the complainant is offered retribution against the assailant if any family contacts the police for a formal complaint. Females stay in the perpetrator’s possession throughout the entire testifying process, which results in pressure and violations. It ensures a positive outcome for the offender. Following the crisis, 50 families every month move to escape these circumstances.\\n\\nFurthermore, the majority of victims are underage, depicting the hubris of the conversion’s perpetrators. The sheer number of cases also involves influentials themselves preying upon young women and enticing them to convert. When a woman converts, there is no going back, and she is even prohibited from meeting her family by claiming that they are ‘Kafirs.’\\n\\nAdditionally, 87 reported cases between 2012 and 2016 were presented to the Commissioner for Human Rights by the World Sindhi Congress on the 28th Session of the 3rd Universal Periodic Review of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, which highlights the region’s vulnerability to injustice and minority safety.\\n\\nThe case of seven-year-old Priya Kumari, who disappeared on August 19, 2021, while serving sabeel at Ashura, has garnered attention recently.\\n\\nSindh police accused Priya’s parents and relatives of claiming involvement of gypsies in her disappearance. Trifling with the minor’s parent’s emotions, DIG Pir Muhammad Shah on May 31 and Sindh Home Minister Zia-ul-Hassan Lanjhar on June 26, 2024, assert that Priya’s whereabouts have been traced, but neither of them provides any evidence to support their assertions a month later.\\n\\nIn response, members of civil society staged demonstrations at Teen Talwar, Karachi police restored the baton charge and took five people into detention, later releasing them.\\n\\nAlthough Pakistan’s founding fathers frequently reiterated minorities’ equal rights, the white colour in the nation’s flag symbolizes minorities.\\n\\nHe explicitly said “You are free; you are to go to your temples. You are free to go to your mosques or to any other places of worship in the State of Pakistan. You may belong to any religion or caste or creed—that has nothing to do with the business of the State.”\\n\\nHe laid liberal dimensions for the future guidelines of national behavior with minorities by saying, “This country is for all segments of religions and everyone is free to go to his worship place whether it is temple, mosque or church”\\n\\nThe constitutions of 1956, 1962, and 1973 guaranteed all fundamental rights to Pakistanis, irrespective of their faith. The rights to equality, property, freedom, culture, social rights, life and liberty (fair trials of law), and preservation of fundamental rights are all guaranteed by these constitutions.\\n\\nIn addition, Pakistan is a contracting party to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that provides freedom of religion, the right to change one’s religion and combat the use of coercion in this regard. The European Courts of Human Rights issued some guidance on the distinction between acceptable religious influence and coercion.\\n\\nIslam exhorts people to seek out and relentlessly embrace the truth. Many verses in the Quran highlight that people should only adopt Islam voluntarily and from the heart.\\n\\nJust as it is said in Quran 2:256, “Let there be no compulsion in the religion.”\\n\\nAllah Almighty has granted will to people to seek Islam based on their own choices, if he wanted everyone to be Muslim, he gave them Muslim births.\\n\\nAs stated in the Quran, “If it had been thy Lord’s will, they would all have believed – all who are on earth! wilt thou then compel mankind, against their will, to believe!” (Qur’an 10:99)\\n\\nFurthermore, Allah has given people the right to believe, if someone is involved in coercion related to religion he/she is directly disobeying Allah.\\n\\nThus, these purported religious organizations are unable to cite Islam as a justification for avoiding their evil acts.\\n\\nPakistan, which was established in the name of Islam, must uphold the secular state’s Islamic principles while guaranteeing the security of minorities and encouraging their equitable way of life. Leveraging religion and the rule of law for selfish ends is causing unrest and turmoil. Minorities are fleeing their home countries due to a sense of uncertainty and unease, which burdens the receiving nation and may eventually sour relations with it as well.\\n\\nOn the other hand, however, damaging a nation’s standing abroad may lead to problems with secular and peacekeeping nations. The promotion of extremism and injustice can lead to insurgency, allowing external powers to influence to fulfill their interest.\\n\\nPrior to the rise of vigilantism, it is essential to comprehend the solemnity of these events. Such religious institutions shouldn’t have the authority to act on behalf of the law or to issue any legal document. Whereas the Government of Pakistan with Sindh’s local government needs to combat traditional feudalism and obscurantism. It’s important to conduct enlightenment institutions and crusades to educate people about the detrimental effects of conventional feudalism, obstruction, and their rights as a resident of the state. Also, officers, judges, local influentials, and other administration personnel should be held accountable for their biased actions. Forced conversion participants must be suspended. Not only should minorities have equal access to community life so they can stand up to injustice, but also exploiting the use of power should be outlawed. Ensure the ratification of the Sindh Criminal Law (Protection of Minorities) Act 2016, as it is their fundamental right.\\n\\nMost importantly, government administration should be capable enough to have control over local groups and institutions rather than being dependent on them. Regarding this strong legislation, robust governmental structures are required that can withstand justice.\\n\\nThe majority religious community should play a crucial role in supporting their minority brothers and assisting them to achieve equal community life for the well-being of society, rather than submitting to a few influential.\\n\\nBy providing rights and community life to minorities, we can add a positive impact on the native values of our country. For any country’s prosperity, it is necessary to understand the significance of individual life. The reciprocity between the State and the Indigenous should be well-built regardless of religion or any prejudice."}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.714199Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-04T16:36:02.778670Z", "inner_id": 168, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60834, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 144951463, "annotations": [{"id": 53623818, "completed_by": {"id": 60832, "email": "iorwuesesolomon@gmail.com", "first_name": "Fanen", "last_name": "Iorwuese"}, "result": [{"id": "gtHujvfTeo", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Article"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}, {"id": "RYVnO1_DBi", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "coercion_classifier"}, {"id": "CkOxpY1lxM", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "recruitment_classifier"}, {"id": "WPxxxYEoy5", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "transport_classifier"}, {"id": "-oRlcR-qRj", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Child Sexual Exploitation"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_classifier"}, {"id": "oDAmFPuD3P", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_sub_classifier"}], "reviews": [], "history": [{"id": 58662529, "comment": null, "organization_id": 34950, "project_id": 122257, "annotation_id": 53623818, "draft_id": null, "review_id": null, "task_id": 144951463, "result": [{"id": "gtHujvfTeo", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Article"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}, {"id": "RYVnO1_DBi", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "coercion_classifier"}, {"id": "CkOxpY1lxM", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "recruitment_classifier"}, {"id": "WPxxxYEoy5", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "transport_classifier"}, {"id": "-oRlcR-qRj", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Child Sexual Exploitation"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_classifier"}, {"id": "oDAmFPuD3P", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_sub_classifier"}], "lead_time": 31.489, "action": "submitted", "started_at": "2025-01-30T12:51:32.245000Z", "created_at": "2025-01-30T12:52:04.931590Z", "created_by": 60832, "comment_id": null}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-01-30T12:52:04.734617Z", "updated_at": "2025-01-30T12:52:04.734632Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-01-30T12:51:53.478070Z", "lead_time": 31.489, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 6, "unique_id": "3b3db9fa-3ea6-4ccc-8389-23d7d65091fc", "import_id": null, "last_action": "submitted", "bulk_created": false, "task": 144951463, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60832, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": 60832}], "file_upload": "2d869759-batch_5_data.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "agreement": 100.0, "data": {"_id": {"$oid": "67720c7a351814a79e981180"}, "text": "December 28, 2024 – Fresno County Sheriff's Office officials report that on December 13th, detectives with the Central California Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Task Force arrested 26-year-old Robinson Thao and 24-year-old Lily Chang.\\n\\nThe two are husband and wife who live in Fresno.

Timothy Ramaekers suddenly vanished. Surprised? You shouldn’t be.\\n\\nReaders of this blog should remember the Troubling Case of Timothy Ramaekers. Back in 2012, I wrote about how family and friends of Matthew Carrigan protested outside of Aliso Viejo’s Corpus Christi parish, saying that Ramaekers sexually molested Carrigan when Carrigan was a child at St. Justin Martyr Parish in Anaheim between 1978 and 1986.\\n\\nGuess what the Diocese of Orange did …\\n\\nThey did nothing.\\n\\nFast forward to 2019. The State of California passed AB 218, a three-year window for survivors of child sexual abuse. The law allowed child sexual abuse survivors, no matter when they were abused in California, to come forward and use the civil courts for justice.\\n\\nAt least one survivor filed a case against Ramaekers. At this time, I do not know if this is the Carrigan case.\\n\\nWhat did the Diocese of Orange do when one of their priests was SUED for child sexual abuse? (Despite promises to adhere to the USCCB Charter and their own now-rabbit-holed Covenant with the Faithful)\\n\\nNothing. They did NOTHING.\\n\\nA few months ago, a case against Ramaekers was one of ten released in the second set of “bellwether cases” of sexual abuse and cover-up against the diocese of Orange.\\n\\n(Last week, another bellwether against former Mater Dei Principal Michael Harris settled for $3.5 million)\\n\\nAnd guess who has suddenly been “retired?”\\n\\nOh yes … and not retired to a parish where he can say Mass occasionally and help out. No. He’s retired to a PRIVATE RESIDENCE, where he can hide in peace while survivors’ attorneys take depositions and unearth evidence about WHAT the diocese knew about Ramaekers and WHEN they knew it.\\n\\nGee … I wonder if they told the parishioners at Corpus Christi that their pastor is going to trial for sexual abuse?\\n\\n** Note: This site is currently being updated.

They claimed that the filmmakers secretly filmed them in nude or semi-nude scenes without their knowledge, violating child protection laws. The two actors demanded substantial financial compensation for their pain and suffering, claiming that the trauma from the exploitation would affect them for the rest of their lives.\\n\\nAt the time of filming, Leonard was 16 and Oliviay was 15, and both were told by Franco that no nudity would be involved. Yet, during the filming of a bedroom scene, they were instructed to wear body makeup instead of underwear, and Franco allegedly told them that if they didn’t perform the nude scenes, their careers would be over. The actors later revealed that they were forced to comply, fearing the collapse of the movie.\\n\\nOlivia, however, had downplayed the issue in past interviews, stating that she and Leonard were well aware of what was required for the film. She even defended the nudity, calling it necessary for the film’s artistic vision and a landmark moment in American cinema. But in light of the #MeToo movement, both Olivia and Leonard reevaluated their experiences and began speaking out about the exploitation.\\n\\nThe lawsuit was filed after California temporarily suspended the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse claims, but the court ultimately dismissed the case, ruling that the actors had consented to the film’s nudity."}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.714399Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-14T16:22:19.405257Z", "inner_id": 180, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60832, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 144951475, "annotations": [{"id": 54497107, "completed_by": {"id": 60832, "email": "iorwuesesolomon@gmail.com", "first_name": "Fanen", "last_name": "Iorwuese"}, "result": [{"id": "m9dGM8d6AV", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Incident"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}, {"id": "E5vKJTGK0w", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Minor", "Physical Abuse/Threat or force", "Psychological Abuse/Threat or Force", "Sexual Abuse"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "coercion_classifier"}, {"id": "nOKuLEa4u_", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Friendship/Grooming"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "recruitment_classifier"}, {"id": "MJP0N-Z-5D", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "transport_classifier"}, {"id": "E2w7A8gkvW", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Child Sexual Exploitation", "Sexual Exploitation"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_classifier"}, {"id": "wBVXSrnkVK", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Personal Sexual Servitude"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_sub_classifier"}], "reviews": [], "history": [{"id": 59697540, "comment": null, "organization_id": 34950, "project_id": 122257, "annotation_id": 54497107, "draft_id": null, "review_id": null, "task_id": 144951475, "result": [{"id": "m9dGM8d6AV", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Incident"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}, {"id": "E5vKJTGK0w", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Minor", "Physical Abuse/Threat or force", "Psychological Abuse/Threat or Force", "Sexual Abuse"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "coercion_classifier"}, {"id": "nOKuLEa4u_", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Friendship/Grooming"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "recruitment_classifier"}, {"id": "MJP0N-Z-5D", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "transport_classifier"}, {"id": "E2w7A8gkvW", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Child Sexual Exploitation", "Sexual Exploitation"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_classifier"}, {"id": "wBVXSrnkVK", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Personal Sexual Servitude"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_sub_classifier"}], "lead_time": 56.479, "action": "submitted", "started_at": "2025-02-14T16:22:18.995000Z", "created_at": "2025-02-14T16:23:16.938462Z", "created_by": 60832, "comment_id": null}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-14T16:23:16.792971Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-14T16:23:16.792980Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-02-14T16:22:57.657482Z", "lead_time": 56.479, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 6, "unique_id": "f3bb8fdb-e027-42b0-a499-907c11118f2f", "import_id": null, "last_action": "submitted", "bulk_created": false, "task": 144951475, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60832, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": 60832}], "file_upload": "2d869759-batch_5_data.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "agreement": 100.0, "data": {"_id": {"$oid": "67720c7a351814a79e9811b7"}, "text": "Fr András Pajor, a prominent advocate of the ruling Fidesz party’s “political Christianity”, was accused of abuse by former altar boys.\\n\\nThe sexual abuse crisis gripping the Catholic Church in Hungary has expanded to include the Archdiocese of Esztergom-Budapest, headed by the Hungarian primate Cardinal Péter Erdő.\\n\\nAttention previously focused on a wave of suspensions and prosecutions of priests in the Archdiocese of Kalocsa-Kecskemét, which emerged over the autumn.

Hightail.\\n\\nThe AFP’s Northern Command is winding up a year of milestones in disrupting significant and organised crime and keeping Australians safe.\\n\\nA highlight of 2024 is this month’s Operation Tyrrendor, which resulted in the AFP making the largest-ever cocaine seizure in Australia, with the assistance of the Queensland Police Service (QPS) and Australian Border Force (ABF).\\n\\nMore than 2.34 tonnes of cocaine, worth an estimated $760 million, was found onboard a boat intercepted off the Queensland coast during a night-time operation by the AFP’s elite Specialist Response Group.\\n\\nTwo men were arrested on the vessel and another nine men and two young persons, including the vice-president of the Brisbane chapter of the Comancheros outlaw motorcycle gang, were arrested in Bundaberg and Brisbane for their alleged involvement.\\n\\nThe record-breaking seizure equalled nearly half of Australia’s estimated annual total of cocaine consumption*.\\n\\nAFP investigators disrupted another major criminal syndicate in April, targeting a group believed to be responsible for a botched 900kg cocaine import in late 2023 which led to bricks of the drug washing up on NSW beaches.\\n\\nOperation Groot was a joint AFP, QPS, ABF, Department of Home Affairs and Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission (ACIC) investigation which resulted in charges against 23 people for their alleged involvement in the syndicate and its activities. Those arrested included a Brisbane man, 36, who is alleged to have organised the import and is suspected of involvement in at least two others.\\n\\nAFP Commander Stephen Jay and Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC) Deputy Commissioner Donald Yamasombi met earlier this month to observe the destruction of 500 kg of cocaine seized in PNG during Operation Weathers in 2020.\\n\\nCommander Jay said the RPNGC is a committed and vital ally in the fight against transnational drug crime, as demonstrated by Operation Weathers and another joint investigation in 2023 that resulted in 20-year prison sentence for a man accused of organising a methamphetamine importation from PNG into Australia via the Torres Strait.\\n\\nIn total AFP’s Northern Command seized more than 4.6 tonnes of illicit drugs in 2024 with an estimated street value of around $2 billion.\\n\\nA child sex offender who preyed on scores of pre-school age victims was sentenced in the Brisbane District Court to life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 27 years in late November. He was responsible for the abuse of 69 children in childcare centres in Queensland and Italy between 2003 and 2022.\\n\\nAfter nearly a decade, a breakthrough was made by the AFP-led Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation’s (ACCCE) Victim Identification Unit (VIU). AFP investigators from the Queensland Joint Anti-Child Exploitation Team (QLD JACET) arrested the offender, aged 47, in 2022. QLD JACET investigators continue to provide assistance and support to the victims and their families. In July, a Brisbane couple became the first people in Australia to be charged under foreign interference laws that came into effect in 2018.\\n\\nA man, 63, and woman, 40, were arrested by the AFP and ASIO-led Counter Foreign Interference Taskforce (CFITF) for allegedly obtaining Australian Defence Force material to share with Russian authorities. Their case remains before the courts.\\n\\nIt was a busy year at the three Queensland airports where the AFP provides aviation security and policing services.\\n\\nBrisbane, Gold Coast and Cairns Airports saw a total of 33.6 million passengers over the 2023—24 financial year,** with 142 people arrested during the 2024 calendar year.\\n\\nThe arrests were for a range of crimes such as antisocial behaviour on planes and in terminals, theft, security breaches, importing illicit substances and possessing cash believed to be the proceeds of crime.\\n\\nOn December 10 the Pacific Policing Initiative’s Development and Coordination Pinkenba Hub and the Pinkenba Training Centre were officially opened. AFP Commissioner Reece Kershaw said the Pinkenba facility will increase policing capability across the Pacific and allow the region to rise to current and future challenges.\\n\\nAFP Assistant Commissioner Justine Gough said 2024 was a standout year for the AFP’s Northern Command.\\n\\n“The courage, ingenuity and hard work of our AFP members has made our region a lot safer for the Queensland and Australian community this year,” Assistant Commissioner Gough said.\\n\\n“We have seized more illicit substances and made more arrests than ever before.\\n\\n“We’ve significantly disrupted organised crime in this state and crippled criminal groups for years to come.\\n\\n“Whether it is minimising the harm of illicit drugs, countering extremism, saving people from human exploitation, combatting cybercrime or protecting the travelling public at our airports, the AFP is steadfast in its commitment to keep Australians safe.”\\n\\n*ACIC – Illicit Drug Data Report 2020-21\\n\\n**Brisbane Airport Annual Report 2024, Queensland Airports Limited Annual Report 2024"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.714448Z", "updated_at": "2025-01-30T12:54:20.421013Z", "inner_id": 183, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60832, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 144951478, "annotations": [{"id": 53623937, "completed_by": {"id": 60832, "email": "iorwuesesolomon@gmail.com", "first_name": "Fanen", "last_name": "Iorwuese"}, "result": [{"id": "mfbfA_SV5B", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Article"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}, {"id": "UJRrx8rw7D", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Alcohol/Drugs", "Physical Abuse/Threat or force", "Psychological Abuse/Threat or Force"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "coercion_classifier"}, {"id": "0mAVlhHhiS", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "recruitment_classifier"}, {"id": "sQUFtTKsW2", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "transport_classifier"}, {"id": "ejnC_wbMm1", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Sexual Exploitation"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_classifier"}, {"id": "vhdfWmkYVX", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_sub_classifier"}], "reviews": [], "history": [{"id": 58662679, "comment": null, "organization_id": 34950, "project_id": 122257, "annotation_id": 53623937, "draft_id": null, "review_id": null, "task_id": 144951478, "result": [{"id": "mfbfA_SV5B", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Article"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}, {"id": "UJRrx8rw7D", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Alcohol/Drugs", "Physical Abuse/Threat or force", "Psychological Abuse/Threat or Force"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "coercion_classifier"}, {"id": "0mAVlhHhiS", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "recruitment_classifier"}, {"id": "sQUFtTKsW2", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "transport_classifier"}, {"id": "ejnC_wbMm1", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Sexual Exploitation"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_classifier"}, {"id": "vhdfWmkYVX", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_sub_classifier"}], "lead_time": 136.112, "action": "submitted", "started_at": "2025-01-30T12:54:20.440000Z", "created_at": "2025-01-30T12:56:37.603992Z", "created_by": 60832, "comment_id": null}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-01-30T12:56:37.462564Z", "updated_at": "2025-01-30T12:56:37.462576Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-01-30T12:54:41.569071Z", "lead_time": 136.112, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 6, "unique_id": "2abc3be5-ccd9-4387-8f70-101cac0665c6", "import_id": null, "last_action": "submitted", "bulk_created": false, "task": 144951478, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60832, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": 60832}], "file_upload": "2d869759-batch_5_data.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "agreement": 100.0, "data": {"_id": {"$oid": "67720c7a351814a79e9811a1"}, "text": "Trigger warning: This article includes references to and descriptions of sexual assault.\\n\\nFlorida-based real estate tycoon Shlomy Alexander and his wife Orly own a vast collection of multimillion-dollar properties in multiple states.

Social Services determined an employee in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at Henrico Doctors' Hospital physically abused a premature infant at the hospital in September 2023, according to a letter to sent to the baby's mother from the agency.\\n\\nNoah Hackey’s parents showed CBS 6 the letter which was authored by Child Protective Services Supervisor Sarah Wilson on Sept. 26, 2024.\\n\\nNoah’s parents, Tori and Dominique Hackey reached out to CBS 6 after seeing our report Thursday about Henrico Doctors’ Hospital pausing admission to their NICU because three babies were found in late November and December with “unexplained fractures,” and the incidents were similar to incidents in the summer of 2023 involving four babies.\\n\\nWATCH: Henrico Doctors' Hospital pauses NICU admissions after babies had 'unexplainable fractures'\\n\\nHenrico Doctors' Hospital pauses NICU admissions after babies had 'unexplainable fractures'\\n\\nThe couple had twin boys, Noah and Micah, at the hospital on Aug. 25, 2023, when they were 28 weeks and 6 days old.\\n\\nBoth boys stayed together in a room in the NICU and Noah, in particular, thrived right away.\\n\\n\"Noah was a healthy baby boy. He was on CPAP for maybe two days and then taken off,” Dominique Hackey said.\\n\\nBut, on Sept. 5, the couple received some startling news.\\n\\n“A nurse was standing over Noah swaddling him, looked back and said I noticed his left leg wasn’t moving, it was kind of discolored, I told the doctor on staff, got some x-rays, and we determined he had a fracture to his leg, so we are going to splint it for the next two weeks, and then she was like do you want to hold him?” Dominique said.\\n\\nThe couple said no.\\n\\n“In my mind I’m like, I don’t want them to turn it around on us and say we broke his leg or anything like that so I was like no, we don’t want to hold him, we are just going to process this,” Dominique said.\\n\\nDominique showed CBS 6 a picture of Noah’s x-ray which showed the fracture.\\n\\n\"They said it was the tibia that was fractured. That little piece there is what the fracture was.”\\n\\nDominique then told his mother, a nurse, about the fracture.\\n\\n“She said, 'That is not right. I’ve worked in multiple NICUs, and there has never ever been a fracture,'” Dominique said.\\n\\nHe said she immediately contacted Child Protective Services to report the injury.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Dominique said the hospital leadership seemed to suggest the injury was accidental.\\n\\n“That’s what they told us, that it could have been done because an injection was given and maybe they did it too hard and it caused the fracture.”\\n\\nBy January, Henrico Police and a prosecutor had reached out to the couple as part of their investigation.\\n\\nAnd, in September, they received the letter from Henrico’s Department of Social Services.\\n\\nIn the letter it states \"following a through CPS investigation this agency has determined the disposition of this report to be founded level 1 for physical abuse of Noah by an employee by the Henrico Doctor’s Hospital NICU.”\\n\\nLevel one is the most serious level of child abuse or neglect in Virginia.\\n\\n“It was intentional, it was child abuse, it was the most severe level that it can be. That definitely opened our eyes to it because nobody had said that before. Nobody said this was child abuse, this was intentional,” Dominique said. “You do anything to protect them, you vow that. As a father of my son I vow to protect them and do everything, and I am helpless.”\\n\\nDominique said it was not until October of this year that police told them other NICU babies experienced similar injuries around the same time.\\n\\nBut, they said they could not figure out who hurt the babies.\\n\\n“It’s my baby boy. I feel like I’ve done nothing to protect him and that hurts. It pisses me off,” Dominique said.\\n\\nStill, Dominique and his wife were so busy caring for the twins that they accepted those findings, and the hospital’s word, that they had instituted preventative measures like cameras in the NICU and more training, to ensure this never happened again.\\n\\nThat is, until Thursday, when a friend sent them our story about the hospital’s NICU pausing admissions after three more babies were found with unexplained injuries in November and December of this year.\\n\\n“We couldn’t believe it, instant anger, instant tears, because it’s not supposed to happen again, it’s not supposed to happen in the first place,” Dominique said.\\n\\nNow, he said he blames himself or not reaching out to the news to share his story long ago.\\n\\n“That’s one of my biggest regrets, not reaching out sooner and saying something because it could have prevented somebody else’s child from getting hurt.”\\n\\nThankfully, Noah made a full recovery and the twins are thriving at home in Chesterfield.\\n\\nBut, the couple now wants justice for Noah, and for the other babies who were injured while in the NICU at Henrico Doctors’ Hospital.\\n\\n“Somebody needs to be held accountable for my son, for everybody’s kid, somebody needs to be held accountable, it’s too many in such a short period of time,” Dominique said.\\n\\nThe Hackeys are asking anyone with questions about their story, or who may have experienced something similar at Henrico Doctors’ Hospital, to reach out to them.\\n\\nIf you reach out to Melissa Hipolit, she can put you in touch with them.\\n\\nWe asked HCA, which owns the hospital, some questions about what actions they took in 2023 to investigate and prevent future harm to NICU babies, but a spokesperson did not answer those questions and said they did not have anything to add to their official statement, which can be found on the HCA Virginia website.\\n\\nIn that statement, they said healthcare professionals are reviewing video footage and that footage was also provided to the proper authorities.\\n\\nSo far, they have not found any misconduct or accidental actions that could have caused the fractures.\\n\\nIn the meantime, the hospital said it is taking these steps to enhance safety in the NICU:\\n\\n\\n\\nRequiring all NICU caregivers to participate in supplemental unit-wide, in-person safety training programs.\\n\\nAdopting the practice of conducting additional head-to-toe examinations of each NICU baby, led by neonatologists.\\n\\nInstituting mandatory training for all healthcare providers who interact with minors, educating the providers on the identification and reporting of suspected neglect or abuse.\\n\\nInstalling new security systems to ensure proper care and parents’ peace of mind:\\n\\nA camera system that records all activity in our NICU rooms 24/7 and is available for viewing in real time or at a later date Live-streaming technology allowing parents to view their babies An observer system where each provider in the NICU is accompanied by another clinician when they are present in a baby’s room to help ensure all protocols are followed\\n\\n\\n\\nThe spokesperson added that they are working closely with the families of the babies currently in the NICU, and the majority of those families have decided to remain in their care.\\n\\nHenrico Police are partnering with several state agencies, including the Virginia State Police and the Attorney General’s Office, to investigate the babies injuries.\\n\\nCBS 6 is committed to sharing community voices on this important topic.

"67720c7a351814a79e980fac"}, "text": "While driving past a house, a man noticed that a convicted pedophile was trying to once again lure children into his backyard. Instead of allowing the predator to hurt another child, the vigilante decided to take justice into his own hands.\\n\\nWhile searching for an apartment, Omaha middle school employee James Fairbanks, 43, discovered that a convicted sex offender lived just a few doors down from the location in which he hoped to move. Hoping to get a better idea of the man’s whereabouts, Fairbanks drove past the residence to see a scene that would change his life forever.\\n\\nAccording to an open letter, Fairbanks alleges that he saw 64-year-old convicted sex pedophile Matteio Condoluci stalking a pair of young children only yards away. He then looked into Condoluci’s backyard to find a child’s playhouse set up in a way that any little girl or boy could easily access it.\\n\\nAfter witnessing what he knew to be a predatory tactic, Fairbanks decided he had to stop Condoluci from making another child his victim. Heart pounding, Fairbanks claims that he grabbed his pistol and headed over to the pedophile’s residence to scare him into staying away from the nearby children. Unfortunately, things didn’t go quite as planned.\\n\\nIn a shocking social media post directed at the media, Fairbanks confessed to murdering Condoluci, who had been convicted for assaulting a 5-year-old boy and raping a 13-year-old girl, explaining his reasoning for his actions, Daily Mail reports. Condoluci only served 2-and-a-half years in prison.\\n\\n“Dear media, I am writing this email to let you know that I killed Matteio Condoluci,” Fairbanks began. “While out apartment searching and checking the neighborhoods I wanted to live in I stumbled across his sex offender registry info. I read where he had molested (raped) two children and been convicted twice yet only served two years in prison. For RAPING CHILDREN!…I drove by and to my horror he was standing in his driveway pretending to wash his truck (no soap or water just a rag) while staring at a group of children playing in the street. I watched him for a few minutes and just felt sick to my stomach. He just kept staring at them…I went to drive away and noticed to my amazement this twice convicted sex offender had a playground set in his backyard! No fence. Just a slide and a play house. I felt sick to my stomach. Having had my own experience with these type of predators I knew the damage he would do to those kids. It agonized me for days. I couldn’t sleep.”\\n\\nFairbanks explained that he had a similar experience with a predator molesting a close relative when he was young and that the situation brought back terrible memories of the abuse. He wrote that he couldn’t sleep for days and ultimately decided to confront Condoluci, which led to him killing the pedophile.\\n\\n“I’ve worked with kids for years who have been victimized and I couldnt in good conscience allow him to do it to anyone else while I had the means to stop him. I’m willing to turn myself in even though I’m confident I wouldn’t be caught because it’s my opinion that we need to fix this in our society. We cannot let this continue to happen to our children. They must be stopped. I know in this messed up judicial system that means I will face far more severe punishment for stopping him than he did for raping KIDS. But I could no longer do nothing,” he wrote.\\n\\nFairbanks claims that he forced Condoluci into his home at gunpoint in order to threaten him to stay away from the children. He says that Condoluci rushed toward him in an attempt to disarm him, prompting Fairbanks to shoot him in the chest.\\n\\nWhile Fairbanks’ confession drew overwhelming praise from the public, one registered sex offender identified only as “Jay” says that the killing has stricken terror in the hearts of convicts like himself, according to KETV.\\n\\n“You don’t go out there and take it into our own hands and murder and take the life of somebody else because you weren’t happy with the judgement that was made,” he said.\\n\\nLaura Smith, who lost her son to a drug overdose nearly two decades after she says he was sexually assaulted by Condoluci at age 5, thanked Fairbanks for taking revenge on her child’s abuser. She has since started a petition to free Fairbanks, adding that Condoluci had raped two children and molested countless others.\\n\\nFairbanks was charged with first-degree murder for the death of Condoluci. However, he maintains that he was simply protecting children from the sex offender and didn’t intend to kill him, although he believes Condoluci would’ve definitely abused again.\\n\\nFairbanks doesn’t consider himself a hero, despite many others claiming he is. Instead of trying to free him, he hopes that his followers will focus their efforts on reforming laws concerning sex offenders. Incredibly, his message has garnered major support for the movement to protect children from sexual predators."}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.714584Z", "updated_at":

reveal new details in the death of a 26-year-old escort in Escambia County.\\n\\nDeputies say mid-December. He faces more than 30 child porn possession charges on top of the first-degree murder charge.\\n\\nA pre-trial detention hearing on Dec. 26 resulted in a judge without bond pending trial.\\n\\nEvidence of murder\\n\\nAccording to the arrest report filed with the Escambia County Clerk of Courts, investigators believe Ellington murdered Bennett on Dec. 13 in her hotel room at Sweet Dream Inn off Davis Highway.\\n\\nIn speaking with the victim's cousin, deputies report Bennett had been traveling state to state obtaining clients (under the management of a pimp) and dancing. A missing persons investigator from the Escambia County Sheriff's Office reports the Houston native was in town for a couple of days working as a stripper and escort.\\n\\nThe report states concerned friends began calling the front desk at the hotel on Dec. 13 due to a complete cutoff of communication from Bennett. The loved ones allegedly begged staff to check on her. The cousin told investigators Bennett's son had a birthday coming up and she would not miss it.\\n\\nA front desk worker allegedly checked Bennett's room late that night. She found the door cracked open but no one was inside, according to the report.\\n\\nThe person who called Escambia County Sheriff's Office to report Bennett missing said hotel staff informed her they found two cell phones in the hotel bathtub, a black electrical cord under the bed and a missing alarm clock. Deputies include in their report the cell phones were wet when retrieved from the tub. Both the person who reported Bennet missing and her pimp told investigators Bennett would never go anywhere without her phone. The report states the victim's 360 Live GPS tracking was off.\\n\\nCrime scene investigators documented finding an eyelash on the floor and a stone type object in the parking lot that matched the appearance of Bennett's earring (as observed on prior video footage). The last time Bennett was seen on camera was purchasing another night at the hotel hours before she went missing.\\n\\nTimeline\\n\\nThe person who reported Bennett missing said she last communicated with her on Dec. 13 around 2 p.m. central time. The arrest report said Bennett made a post online searching for a client and told her friend the client would send payment via the money transfer app Cash App.\\n\\nThe friend told deputies the victim's phone went dead despite having a 60% charge.\\n\\nThe Escambia County Sheriff's Office homicide unit began assisting the investigation after deputies discovered none of Bennett's family members had been in contact with her since her disappearance.\\n\\nThe report states work trucks parked at Sweet Dreams Inn have video footage showing a red Mazda parked in front of Bennett's room at the approximate time when the victim was last in contact with anyone. The report narrative states the video footage is 11 minutes long. The report reads, \"it appeared someone peeked through the curtains of room #130 during the time span of the video.\"\\n\\nIn searching for the owner of the Mazda, deputies uncovered it is rented out by the owner. The manager told Escambia County Sheriff's Office the car was rented by Ellington around 9 a.m. Dec. 13 and returned two days later around 11 p.m.\\n\\n\"After asking if she could provide any information on the person who rented the car,\" the report reads, \"[the manager] made the statement that it was weird because the user profile was deleted.\"\\n\\nShe was able to give law enforcement Ellington's name, phone number and job. Ellington is a Marine stationed onboard NAS Pensacola.\\n\\nTalking to Ellington\\n\\nInvestigators attempted to contact Ellington using the phone number provided by the rental car manager, according to the report. After an unsuccessful attempt, investigators sent a text asking the marine to call them.\\n\\nAfter trying to use work as an excuse, Ellington agreed to meet deputies on base.\\n\\nThe report says, during their meeting, Ellington made comments he would talk to them so his phone didn't get taken. They seized it anyway.\\n\\nAfter deputies explained their missing persons investigation and the fact his rental car was seen parked in front of the hotel room at the time she went missing, Ellington allegedly asked investigators how they knew that.\\n\\nA search warrant was executed for the contents of Ellington's iPhone that day.\\n\\nPhone records\\n\\nComputer crimes downloaded the cell phone and found communication between Ellington and Bennett. It indicates Ellington arrived at Sweet Dream Inn off Davis Highway just before 3 p.m.\\n\\nReviewing the data downloaded from the cell phone, investigators report finding\\n\\nWhat state is a corpse in after 2 days\\n\\nCan a murderer be convicted without a body\\n\\nHow many prostitute murders go unsolved\\n\\nCan police track snapchat\\n\\nWill police know if someone changed their number\\n\\nDefense attorneys\\n\\nHow long can you live after being stabbed\\n\\nDo people scream when being strangled\\n\\nMultiple other death and murder searches\\n\\nWhile searching through the phone's contents, investigators found a receipt from Navy Exchange indicating the suspect bought a 3-foot rolling duffle bag within the hour before meeting Bennett.\\n\\nFinding Bennett\\n\\nUsing investigative techniques, detectives say, they were able to find out Ellington was seen traveling to and from Mobile. They were able to track Ellington's phone movement. On Dec. 18, they located Bennett's body \"in a small body of water in a wooded area.\"\\n\\nFinding Ellington\\n\\nEscambia County Sheriff's Office reports when military personnel went to locate the suspect on case Dec. 18, they found he escaped the base. The arrest report reads, \"information was provided that Ellington was selling his personal items and inquiring about a greyhound bus.\"\\n\\nLee County, Ala., deputies found and arrested Ellington in Opelika, Ala. (near Auburn). At first, he gave them a fake name.\\n\\nMore charges\\n\\nWhen searching through Ellington's phone during the missing person turned murder investigation, investigators found files depicting child sex abuse.\\n\\nEllington faces 35 charges for possession of child porn, transmitting child porn and using a phone to commit a felony.\\n\\nEscambia County Sheriff's Office's Computer Forensics Unit team members found pictures and videos depicting young girls being sexually abused. Investigators estimated the victims appeared to be 11-12 years old.\\n\\nAfter a secondary search warrant was signed by a judge, investigators report finding at least 50 additional files. The victims in these images range in age from nine to 16, according to the investigator.\\n\\nThe charges were enhanced, deputies say, after they located several files that showed the \"sodomy of a female toddler.\"\\n\\nInvestigators report, in addition to having the images, they located multiple threads showing Ellington shared the files with other people."}, "meta": {}, "created_at":

County sheriff‘s deputy accused of harassing and abducting a woman was charged Monday with kidnapping and other offenses.\\n\\nAlexander Ravy Vanny, 33, of Hemet was arrested last Thursday following an investigation by the sheriff’s department’s Special Victims Unit that was initiated earlier this year.\\n\\nAlong with kidnapping, Vanny is charged with stalking, unauthorized use of protected computer data, maliciously destroying a wireless device and committing a felony while on bail.\\n\\nVanny, who is being held without bail at the Smith Correctional Facility in Banning, was slated to make his initial court appearance Monday afternoon at the Southwest Justice Center in Murrieta.\\n\\nThe defendant had been free on a $1 million bond following an earlier arrest in June.\\n\\nAccording to sheriff’s Sgt. Mike Kelleher, Special Victims Unit detectives received word at the end of November regarding Vanny’s alleged harassment of the woman whose complaints earlier this year had prompted the original investigation into the defendant’s alleged misconduct.\\n\\nSufficient evidence was gathered to book the former lawman into custody.\\n\\nVanny was first arrested on June 22 following the Special Victims Unit’s findings from an investigation that began weeks before when the victim, identified in court documents only as “M.P.G.,” told a law enforcement officer that she allegedly had been assaulted by the defendant.\\n\\nAt the time, the victim was confirmed to be a sheriff’s department volunteer at the Hemet station, where Vanny was then assigned.\\n\\nHe was booked into the Banning jail but posted a $1 million bond and was released. He was initially placed on paid administrative leave, but within a few months, he was fired from the department, according to sheriff’s officials.\\n\\nThe criminal complaint against him alleges that he abducted M.P.G. sometime between May and December. The document states that sometime between August and December, he “unlawfully, maliciously and repeatedly followed and harassed” the victim.\\n\\nHe also gleaned specific data from a government computer system, copied it and loaded the information onto his personal electronic device, the complaint alleges.\\n\\nIt further says that in the previous five months, he allegedly destroyed a mobile phone “to prevent the use of the (phone) to … notify law enforcement of a crime.”\\n\\nNo additional details were provided.\\n\\nWhile he was on bail, Vanny was separately charged with possession of child pornography.\\n\\nHe had been a sworn peace officer since he was hired by the sheriff’s department in 2016.\\n\\nFor More Visit www.zapinin.com/law-and-disorder"}, "meta": {}, "created_at":

SitAn, of Children in Nigeria Report has identified some of the reasons why 53.9 per cent of children in the country are multi-dimensionally poor.\\n\\nThe report, launched during the 2024 World Children’s Day celebration on Nov. 20, is a policy document prepared by the Federal Government with support from the United Nations Children’s Fund, UNICEF, to identify and understand specific child issues.\\n\\nAccording to the report, corruption, unemployment, lack of political will, violence and insurgency and inadequate investment in social sectors play significant roles in making Nigerian children poor.\\n\\nIt added that displacement and resettlement place additional pressure on existing resources, further exacerbating child poverty in Nigeria.\\n\\nThe report defined child poverty as “a situation where children experience deprivation of the material, spiritual and emotional resources needed to stay alive, develop and thrive, thus leaving them unable to enjoy their rights, achieve their full potential and participate as full and equal members of society.”\\n\\nIt stated that the seven poverty indicators for children are: health, water, sanitation, nutrition, shelter, education and information.\\n\\nExplaining the Multidimensional Poverty Index, MPI, analysis, the report noted that across the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, disparities exist in the multi-dimensional poverty of children.\\n\\nIt added that “in Osun State, the incidence of poverty was lowest at 17.5 per cent, incidence of deprivation was 35.5 per cent and the Human Development Index (HDI) ranking was 14th in Nigeria.\\n\\n“In Sokoto State, the incidence of poverty was very high at 89.9 per cent, incidence of deprivation was 50.4 per cent and the HDI ranking was 37 per cent.\\n\\n“In Lagos State, poverty incidence was 27.8 per cent, incidence of deprivation was 36.8 per cent, while the HDI ranking was one per cent.”\\n\\nThe report indicated that when disaggregated by rural and urban, 29.7 per cent of urban children were multi-dimensionally poor against 65.7 per cent of rural children.\\n\\nIt added that children living in Sokoto State 80.4 per cent, Kebbi 74.9 per cent and Zamfara 74 per cent were worse off, experiencing the highest multidimensional deprivation.\\n\\n“On the other hand, less than 20 per cent of children living in Edo (19 per cent) and Lagos State (17.3 per cent) were multi-dimensionally poor.\\n\\n“Multi-dimensionally poor children living in Sokoto State deprived in 74.1 per cent of the total number of deprivations compared to 57.7 per cent of children living in Lagos.”\\n\\nIt said that households with higher number of members and/or children show higher multidimensional deprivation rates than smaller households.\\n\\nIt also implied that children in homes with uneducated household heads and/or mothers are more likely to be multi-dimensionally poor compared with children whose household heads attained secondary or higher education levels.\\n\\nIt stated that a larger proportion of children with illiterate mothers are multi-dimensionally poor than children with literate mothers.\\n\\n“A striking case of multiple deprivations among children can be observed in the case of Almajiri children.\\n\\n“These children are always on the move and are deprived of decent living conditions, good food and nutrition, water and basic sanitation, access to healthcare facilities, access to education and parental care.\\n\\n“They are also deprived protection from violence and abuse, participation in decisions affecting their lives, and are often subjected to child labour and abuse.\\n\\n“They are also taken advantage of during times of conflict and often obliged to carry arms.”\\n\\nTo ameliorate the situation, the report recommended that stakeholders should play certain roles.\\n\\nIt said that family and close caregivers should play crucial roles in alleviating child poverty and

the continent.\\n\\nThe Church of England is facing a long overdue reckoning in Africa. Its leader, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, announced his resignation in November after an independent review brought attention to his failure to report to the authorities the barrister John Smyth, a prolific abuser of children.\\n\\nSmyth is found to have physically, sexually and psychologically abused more than 100 boys and young men over four decades at Church of England-affiliated summer camps in England, South Africa and my country, Zimbabwe. He died in Cape Town, South Africa in 2018, at the age of 77, without ever being held accountable.\\n\\nThe independent review into Smyth’s alleged crimes, and the Church’s attempts to cover them up, makes for harrowing reading.\\n\\nHis “appalling” abuse of boys in England was identified by the Church as early as 1982, the review found, but he was not exposed to the public nor held to account by the authorities. Instead, he was encouraged to leave the country and moved to Zimbabwe without any referral being made to police. It is believed that he physically and sexually abused at least 80 boys in camps he ran there in the 1990s.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nPerhaps his most horrific crime took place in Marondera, just outside Harare in December 1992. A 16-year-old boy named Guide Nyachuru drowned under suspicious circumstances at a camp presided over by Smyth. Smyth was initially charged with culpable homicide, but the case was mysteriously dropped after dragging on for a long time with little progress and many mistakes on the part of the investigators. Smyth eventually moved to South Africa, facing no accountability for his alleged role in Nyachure’s death.\\n\\nThe abuse Smyth inflicted on boys in what were supposed to be nurturing, religious settings of learning and growth was unfortunately not an anomaly. In the years that Smyth was active in my country, the abuse of children by clergy appears to have been endemic in many other settings. I first became vaguely aware of allegations of abuse within my Catholic boarding school in 1989-90, when I was a pupil at the Jesuit-run St Ignatius College, near Harare. There were rumours of the things a few priests did to the younger boys. Yet no one talked about it openly or attempted to do anything to stop it.\\n\\nI learned about the true scope of clergy abuse at Zimbabwean Catholic schools years later, when I started to do research for a novel I have just completed on abuse at a fictional Catholic boarding school. As part of my research, I talked directly to some of the boys, now men, who said they were abused at my old school, and at two other elite Jesuit schools in Zimbabwe – St George’s College and St Francis Xavier popularly known as Kutama. They gave an account of horrific abuse, inflicted on young, vulnerable boys with impunity.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nDuring my interviews, the names of three priests were mentioned most frequently. I learned that, as was the case with Smyth and the Anglican Church, the Catholic Church moved these men around different settings to shield them from accountability. I was told that one of the three, whom two old boys said they witnessed raping a young boy he had picked up off the street in Harare, was eventually moved to Mbare, one of Zimbabwe’s poorest townships. He is alleged to have found more victims there.\\n\\nSo far, only one of these three men has been tried and convicted for the crimes he committed against children, and can therefore be named in this article: James Chaning-Pearce.\\n\\nIn 1997, Chaning-Pearce was convicted of seven counts of indecent assault against boys at a Jesuit School in Lancashire, England and sentenced to three years in prison. However, the Catholic Church played no role in bringing Chaning-Pearce to justice. He faced accountability only because a former pupil at St George’s School in Zimbabwe, who was abused by Chaning-Pearce during his time there, identified him in Australia. He learned that the priest had been named in an inquiry into historic abuse at the school in Lancashire and alerted the British authorities. An investigation had revealed that he had indeed abused children and he was duly extradited from Australia, tried, convicted and sentenced in England. To this day, Chaning-Pearce has never faced any accountability for his alleged abuse of children in Zimbabwe\\n\\nAn acute tragedy of clergy abuse in Zimbabwe is that Catholic schools like St. Ignatius, St. George’s and Kutama attracted some of the brightest children from across the country, many on scholarships. Countless children from poorer families saw these schools as their best chance to make something of themselves. It is heartbreaking to know that so many of them received not the education and nurturing care they were promised, but instead were subjected to horrific abuse.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nA reckoning must come for the Catholic and Anglican churches in Africa, just as it has in the United States and Europe. Just as they did elsewhere, the Anglican and Catholic churches must launch full inquiries into historical sex abuse at their schools in Zimbabwe, and elsewhere in Africa. African victims deserve, as much as victims in other parts of the world, to receive, if not justice, then accountability.\\n\\nIn announcing his resignation over the mishandling of the Smyth abuse scandal, Archbishop Welby said he hopes his decision to step down makes clear “how seriously the Church of England understands the need for change and our profound commitment to creating a safer church”.\\n\\nIn 2018, the head of the Catholic Church, Pope Francis, had similarly acknowledged fully and apologised for his church’s failings in responding to clergy abuse.\\n\\nIn an unprecedented letter to all the world’s Catholics, he promised that no effort would be spared to prevent clerical sex abuse and its coverup.\\n\\n“The heart-wrenching pain of these victims, which cries out to heaven, was long ignored, kept quiet or silenced,” the pope wrote. “With shame and repentance, we acknowledge as an ecclesial community that we were not where we should have been, that we did not act in a timely manner, realizing the magnitude and the gravity of the damage done to so many lives. We showed no care for the little ones; we abandoned them.”\\n\\nIt provides a great sense of comfort and relief to see that after decades of silence and attempted coverups, the Catholic and Anglican churches are finally acknowledging past mistakes and are promising to do better to safeguard children in the future. But so far, their repentance seems to be directed solely towards white victims of clergy abuse in the West.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHowever, children in Zimbabwe and across Africa suffered as much from predatory priests as their white peers did in England, Ireland, and the United States. The churches need to take swift, meaningful action to acknowledge their pain and offer these broken boys, now men, a chance at justice. To fail to do so would be to say the victims of clergy abuse do not matter as long as they are Black Africans.\\n\\nThe views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily

recently sentenced to 100 years in prison without the possibility of parole.\\n\\nZachary and William Zulock, a wealthy couple who adopted two boys with the help of a now-defunct Christian adoption agency, faced sentences for multiple other charges, including child molestation, sexual exploitation of children and incest, according to a press release from the Alcovy Judicial Circuit District Attorney Randy McGinley.\\n\\n“These two defendants truly created a house of horrors and put their extremely dark desires above everything and everyone else,” McGinley said.\\n\\n“The depth of the defendants’ depravity, which is as deep as it gets, is not greater than the resolve of those that fought for justice and the strength of the victims in this case. The resolve I have seen from these two young victims over the last two years is truly inspiring.”\\n\\nJudge Jeffrey L. Foster sentenced both men on Dec. 19 to a century in prison, followed by life on probation.\\n\\nIn July 2022, the Walton County Sheriff’s Office in Georgia received a “cyber tip” from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children informing them that homemade child pornography had been uploaded to the internet from an IP address in the county, which is about 30 miles east of Atlanta.\\n\\nAfter discovering and questioning secondary suspect Hunter Lawless, authorities found that Lawless had received pornography of child sexual abuse from a man named “Zach Zulock,” according to the Walton County Sheriff’s Office.\\n\\nLawless pleaded guilty to sexual exploitation of children and was sentenced to 20 years, with the first 12 years in prison. He also agreed to cooperate in any prosecution of the Zulocks.\\n\\nAfter police conducted a search of the Zulocks’ home in nearby Oxford, Georgia, they found evidence that the Zulocks were “engaging in sexually abusive acts and video documenting this abuse,” according to the Walton County Sheriff’s Office.\\n\\nIn Snapchat messages to Lawless, Zachary boasted about the sexual abuse of his son before sending footage of the acts, according to The New York Post. “I’m going to f— my son tonight. Stand by,” he reportedly said.\\n\\nThe Alcovy Judicial Circuit District Attorney’s Office claimed their investigation of the Zulocks’ house and electronic devices provided evidence that they were sexually abusing their underage, adopted sons to make child pornography.\\n\\n“A thorough analysis found videos of multiple incidents of the defendants committing sexual abuse in different parts of the house,” the district attorney said. “Cell phones were analyzed which contained graphic images and videos of the abuse as well as graphic text and social media messages about the sexual abuse.”\\n\\nA 2023 investigation by Townhall uncovered more details about the Zulocks, including the fact that Zachary was the focus of a pedophilia investigation in 2011 after being accused of engaging in sexual acts with a 14-year-old boy in Walton County. The investigation was dropped with no charges filed, though it was subsequently reopened following the Townhall article.\\n\\nA family member told Townhall in 2023 that the brothers — who were aged 9 and 11 at the time — were raised by struggling heroin addicts. One relative of the boys told the outlet they believe the Zulocks used that information to target the vulnerable boys.\\n\\nMcGinley praised the work of others who assisted in bringing the Zulocks to justice.\\n\\n“I am grateful for the hard work of so many to obtain an appropriate outcome in this case. The hard work of law enforcement put an end to the abuse suffered by the victims, and this resolution will help the victims continue their process of healing,” he said. “William and Zachary Zulock will now spend 100 years in prison without parole. This all but guarantees that the victims will not have to worry as they grow older about their abusers being free.”\\n\\nThe boys were removed from the Zulocks’ custody and are “now safe” after the Walton County Division of Family & Children Services took them, according to authorities.\\n\\nSource: Christian Post"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.714735Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-13T16:01:19.643596Z", "inner_id": 200, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 61348, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 144951495, "annotations": [{"id": 53575341, "completed_by": {"id": 61348, "email": "louis.bartlett@diegesis.co.uk", "first_name": "", "last_name": ""}, "result": [{"id": "FfV7dIfXC9", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Alcohol/Drugs", "Minor", "Physical Abuse/Threat or force", "Psychological Abuse/Threat or Force", "Restricts Movement/Isolates", "Sexual Abuse", "Use of Psychoactive Substances"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "coercion_classifier"}, {"id": "CTICyoO4Dz", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Incident"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}, {"id": "n0C1tU4hHA", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Child Sexual Exploitation", "Sexual Exploitation"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_classifier"}, {"id": "jpDva6-Rsb", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "recruitment_classifier"}, {"id": "qc8lWaCArM", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "transport_classifier"}, {"id": "XuY23-bI6s", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_sub_classifier"}], "reviews": [], "history": [{"id": 58602308, "comment": null, "organization_id": 34950, "project_id": 122257, "annotation_id": 53575341, "draft_id": null, "review_id": null, "task_id": 144951495, "result": [{"id": "FfV7dIfXC9", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Alcohol/Drugs", "Minor", "Physical Abuse/Threat or force", "Psychological Abuse/Threat or Force", "Restricts Movement/Isolates", "Sexual Abuse", "Use of Psychoactive Substances"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "coercion_classifier"}, {"id": "CTICyoO4Dz", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Incident"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}, {"id": "n0C1tU4hHA", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Child Sexual Exploitation", "Sexual Exploitation"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_classifier"}, {"id": "jpDva6-Rsb", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "recruitment_classifier"}, {"id": "qc8lWaCArM", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "transport_classifier"}, {"id": "XuY23-bI6s", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_sub_classifier"}], "lead_time": 870.524, "action": "submitted", "started_at": "2025-01-29T15:32:44.052000Z", "created_at": "2025-01-29T15:46:13.987285Z", "created_by": 61348, "comment_id": null}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-01-29T15:46:13.842636Z", "updated_at": "2025-01-29T15:46:13.842648Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-01-29T15:32:40.836291Z", "lead_time": 870.524, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 6, "unique_id": "2f6d0d55-ac42-415d-9149-4c54821c5a4d", "import_id": null, "last_action": "submitted", "bulk_created": false, "task": 144951495, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 61348, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": 61348}], "file_upload": "2d869759-batch_5_data.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "agreement": 100.0, "data": {"_id": {"$oid": "67720c7a351814a79e980f4d"}, "text": "“After years of sharing my story and advocating on Capitol Hill, the Stop Institutional Child Abuse Act has officially passed the U.S Congress. This moment is proof that our voices matter, that speaking out can spark change, and that no child should ever endure the horrors of abuse in silence.” – Paris Hilton\\n\\nCongress passed the Stop Institutional Child Abuse Act, championed by Paris Hilton, and supported by CCHR. The law sets a precedent for future protections for youth from psychiatric-behavioral restraints and other abuses, using strong oversight measures.\\n\\nBy Jan Eastgate\\n\\nPresident CCHR International\\n\\nDecember 27, 2024\\n\\nCCHR praises media personality, businesswoman and mother, Paris Hilton, her movement exposing “troubled teen” abuse, and members of Congress for the recent passage of the Stop Institutional Child Abuse Act. The federal law, championed by Ms. Hilton and supported by CCHR and many other groups, passed unanimously through the U.S. Senate and by a vote of 373 to 33 in the House. On Christmas Eve, the President signed into law the much-needed oversight measures aimed at protecting children from behavioral and psychiatric abuse in institutional care.[1] It marks a monumental children’s human rights achievement for 2024.\\n\\nRepresentatives Ro Khanna (CA-17), Earl L. “Buddy” Carter (GA-01), along with Senators Jeff Merkley (D-OR), John Cornyn (R-TX), and Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), were joined by Ms. Hilton in celebrating the passage of the Act in the House. “Children across the country are at risk of abuse and neglect due to a lack of transparency in institutional youth treatment programs. The industry has gone unchecked for too long,” said Rep. Ro Khanna. “We need some more sunlight on these facilities so we can put a stop to the waste, and the fraud, and abuse in the system. I’m proud to support the Stop Institutional Child Abuse Act and stand with our kids,” said Senator Tuberville.[2] Senator Cornyn stated, “Some children in residential youth programs have faced unimaginable abuse and neglect, and I am proud to have introduced this legislation to help ensure institutional child abuse comes to an end.”[3]\\n\\nHilton, who has been vocal about the abuse she experienced while attending Utah’s Provo Canyon School, a facility once owned by the bankrupted Charter Behavioral Health and now owned by Universal Health Services (UHS) shared a message about the news on Instagram. “After years of sharing my story and advocating on Capitol Hill, the Stop Institutional Child Abuse Act has officially passed the U.S Congress,” she said. “This moment is proof that our voices matter, that speaking out can spark change, and that no child should ever endure the horrors of abuse in silence. I did this for the younger version of myself and the youth who were senselessly taken from us by the Troubled Teen Industry.”[4]\\n\\nShe added, “To the countless survivors who shared their stories, to the families who stood with us, and to the coalition, thank you from the bottom of my heart for standing with me. To the legislators who chose courage over complacency and fought for me: you’ve made my dream come true.”\\n\\nThe act aims to study and ultimately help prevent child abuse in youth residential programs. Not later than 45 days after the date of enactment, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall seek to enter into a contract with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to conduct a study to examine the state of youth in youth residential programs and make recommendations. A report on the findings is to be issued within three years, identifying the “nature, prevalence, severity, and scope of child abuse, neglect, and deaths in youth residential programs, including types of abuse and neglect, causes of abuse, neglect, and deaths, and criteria used to assess abuse, neglect, and deaths.” There is also to be identification of all Federal and State funding sources for youth residential programs, with recommendations for the improvement of oversight of youth residential programs receiving Federal funding.[5]\\n\\nCCHR is particularly encouraged by the study’s focus on determining the “best practices to eliminate the use of physical, mechanical, and chemical restraint and seclusion,” especially in light of the numerous horrific child and teen restraint-related deaths reported in recent years. In the U.S., 37.5% of child or adolescent inpatients in mental health facilities have been subjected to seclusion or restraint.[6]\\n\\nOther celebrities such as Paris Jackson, Kat Von D, Collin Gosselin, and Chet Hanks, have spoken out about the trauma of being held against their will in behavioral facilities during their teens. Many residential treatment hospitals, owned by for-profit behavioral companies, have become a gravy train for investors in a $23 billion-a-year “child abuse” industry.[7]\\n\\nIn 2020, Hilton’s compelling documentary, This is Paris, raised crucial public awareness about the industry. She, the #Breaking Code Silence movement, and others, including CCHR, have demanded reforms. As a teenager in 1999, Hilton spent 11 months in Provo Canyon School, a behavioral residential facility in Utah, where she alleges she was forced to take psychotropic drugs, placed in solitary confinement, and beaten—an experience that caused long-term trauma for her.[8]\\n\\nIn the 1990s, CCHR was instrumental in investigating and exposing the now-defunct Charter Behavioral Health that owned Provo Canyon School. A year after Hilton left the facility, Universal Health Services took ownership of Provo Canyon, which has since been plagued with allegations of abuse. Between 2003 and October 2020, CCHR reported at least 32 abuses in UHS facilities that related to sexual abuse, including several convictions of staff responsible. Other reported cases included 18 instances of abuse involving seclusion rooms or restraints use on children as young as six, three deaths, wrongful deaths, assaults, breaking a patient’s arm and fracturing the nose of another, and at least six suicides that may have been preventable.[9]\\n\\n“The multibillion-dollar troubled teen industry has been able to mislead parents, school districts, child welfare agencies and juvenile justice systems for decades,” said Hilton. “The reason is a systemwide lack of transparency and accountability,” which the new law would address.[10] Ms. Hilton said: “I want these places shut down.”[11]\\n\\nThe enactment of this federal law is vital to initiating stronger oversight and protections, ensuring that those who abuse children and youths are held accountable both criminally and civilly. CCHR also calls for tougher penalties, including the closure of institutions where systemic abuse is found.\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\n[1] Ashleigh Fields, “Biden signs 50 bills, including 1 backed by

This scrutiny is not only a response to historical cases but also a call for accountability and reform within these organizations. In Africa, where the influence of these churches is profound, the legacy of predatory priests who have inflicted harm on young boys cannot be overlooked.\\n\\nThe impact of these abuses extends far beyond the immediate trauma experienced by victims. It has led to a profound mistrust of religious institutions, which are often seen as sanctuaries of hope and moral guidance. A recent report from the United Nations highlighted that in many African countries, the church remains one of the most trusted institutions. However, this trust is eroded when cases of abuse come to light. The need for transparency and accountability is more pressing than ever, as victims seek justice and communities demand change.\\n\\nSocial media has become a powerful platform for survivors and advocates to share their stories and call for action. For instance, a tweet from a prominent African activist recently stated, “The silence surrounding abuse in our churches must end. We owe it to our children to ensure they are safe.” This sentiment resonates widely, as many individuals are now using their voices to demand that churches confront their past and take meaningful steps to protect the vulnerable.\\n\\nThe Catholic Church, in particular, has faced intense scrutiny over its handling of abuse allegations. In 2021, a landmark report in France revealed that over 200,000 children had been sexually abused by clergy since 1950. While this report focused on France, it echoes similar patterns observed in Africa, where the church’s influence is often intertwined with societal norms. The need for comprehensive investigations and support systems for victims is critical, as many survivors remain silent due to fear of retribution or disbelief.\\n\\nIn response to these challenges, some church leaders have begun to advocate for change. For example, the Anglican Church has initiated programs aimed at safeguarding children and providing support for survivors. These initiatives are essential, but they must be accompanied by a genuine commitment to addressing past abuses. A recent study published in the Journal of Child Sexual Abuse emphasized that institutional reforms must prioritize the voices of survivors to create a culture of accountability and healing.\\n\\nMoreover, the role of education in preventing future abuses cannot be overstated. Schools run by these churches must implement robust training programs for staff and clergy on recognizing and reporting abuse. A proactive approach is essential to ensure that children are educated about their rights and empowered to speak out against any form of abuse.\\n\\nCommunity involvement is also crucial in this fight against abuse. Grassroots organizations across Africa are working tirelessly to support survivors and educate communities about the signs of abuse. These organizations often face significant challenges, including limited resources and societal stigma. However, their efforts are vital in creating a safer environment for children. Collaborations between churches and these organizations can foster a more comprehensive approach to safeguarding children.\\n\\nThe path forward requires a collective effort from church leaders, community members, and survivors. It is imperative that the Anglican and Catholic churches not only acknowledge the abuses that have occurred but also take decisive action to prevent future incidents. This includes establishing clear reporting mechanisms, providing support for survivors, and fostering a culture of openness and accountability.\\n\\nAs discussions about abuse within religious institutions continue to evolve, it is essential to remember the voices of those who have suffered. Their stories must not be forgotten, and their calls for justice must be heard. The future of these churches depends on their ability to confront their past, learn from it, and commit to creating safe spaces for all individuals, particularly the most vulnerable among us.\\n\\nIn the words of a survivor who bravely shared their experience, “Healing begins when we speak the truth.” It is time for the Anglican and Catholic churches to embrace this truth, ensuring that the horrors of the past do not define their future."}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.714787Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-16T22:35:09.734967Z", "inner_id": 203, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60833, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 144951498, "annotations": [{"id": 54575572, "completed_by": {"id": 60833, "email": "sskanuk@gmail.com", "first_name": "", "last_name": ""}, "result": [{"id": "d3wQub5MX3", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["False Promises/Deception", "Physical Abuse/Threat or force", "Threat of harm to Individual and/others"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "coercion_classifier"}, {"id": "epHuetaFTi", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Face-2-Face False Job Promise", "Kidnap", "Violence Threats Abuse"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "recruitment_classifier"}, {"id": "TDVaq_gsSf", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Airport/Flight"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "transport_classifier"}, {"id": "jtv0rc_nyf", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_classifier"}, {"id": "pKyGfbDp0o", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Visa"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_sub_classifier"}, {"id": "ZNEvj1nak7", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Incident"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}], "reviews": [], "history": [{"id": 59779712, "comment": null, "organization_id": 34950, "project_id": 122257, "annotation_id": 54575572, "draft_id": null, "review_id": null, "task_id": 144951498, "result": [{"id": "d3wQub5MX3", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["False Promises/Deception", "Physical Abuse/Threat or force", "Threat of harm to Individual and/others"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "coercion_classifier"}, {"id": "epHuetaFTi", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Face-2-Face False Job Promise", "Kidnap", "Violence Threats Abuse"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "recruitment_classifier"}, {"id": "TDVaq_gsSf", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Airport/Flight"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "transport_classifier"}, {"id": "jtv0rc_nyf", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_classifier"}, {"id": "pKyGfbDp0o", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Visa"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_sub_classifier"}, {"id": "ZNEvj1nak7", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Incident"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}], "lead_time": 191.244, "action": "submitted", "started_at": "2025-02-16T22:39:25.429000Z", "created_at": "2025-02-16T22:40:43.603453Z", "created_by": 60833, "comment_id": null}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-16T22:40:43.459161Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-16T22:40:43.459170Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-02-16T22:36:20.335303Z", "lead_time": 191.244, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 6, "unique_id": "7c329724-382c-4ccd-9497-cb0b188658f1", "import_id": null, "last_action": "submitted", "bulk_created": false, "task": 144951498, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60833, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": 60833}], "file_upload": "2d869759-batch_5_data.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "agreement": 100.0, "data": {"_id": {"$oid": "677206a36d195bba0ac44b8e"}, "text": "MULTAN, Dec 28 (APP):The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Composite Circle Bahawalpur on Saturday apprehended two accused involved in human trafficking, abduction and visa fraud.\\n\\nAccording to the FIA spokesperson, the arrested suspects, identified as Muhammad Afzal and Ashfaq Ahmed Muhammad Afzal was a key member of a human trafficking network.

Matt Gaetz’s alleged trafficking of teenage girls to debunked QAnon conspiracy theories about a sexual slavery ring run through online retailer Wayfair.\\n\\nThe common perception of sex trafficking involves a young, passive woman captured by an aggressive trafficker. The woman is hidden and waiting to be rescued by law enforcement. She is probably white, because, as the legal scholar Jayashri Srikantiah writes, the “iconic victim” of trafficking usually is depicted this way.\\n\\nThis is essentially the plot of the “Taken” movies, in which teenage Americans are kidnapped abroad and sold into sexual slavery. Such concerns fuel viral posts and TikTok videos about alleged but unproven trafficking in IKEA parking lots, malls and pizza shops.\\n\\nThis is not how sex trafficking usually occurs.\\n\\nSince 2013, I have researched human trafficking in the midwestern U.S. In interviews with law enforcement, medical providers, case managers, victim advocates and immigration lawyers, I found that even these frontline workers inconsistently define and apply the label “trafficking victim” – especially when it comes to sex trafficking. That makes it harder for these professionals to get trafficked people the help they request.\\n\\nSo here are the facts and the law.\\n\\nWhat Is Sex Trafficking?\\n\\nThe Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 provides the official legal definition for sex and labor trafficking in the United States.\\n\\nIt makes “trafficking in which a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age” a federal crime.\\n\\nIn short, to legally qualify as sex trafficking, a sex act involving an adult must include “force, fraud, and coercion.” This could look like someone – a family member, a romantic partner or a market facilitator colloquially described as a “pimp” or “madam” – physically abusing or threatening another adult into sex for money or resources.\\n\\nWith minors, any and all sexual exchanges – that is, trading sex for something of value like cash or food – are considered sex trafficking.\\n\\nHow common is sex trafficking?\\n\\nData on human trafficking is notoriously messy and difficult to measure. Survivors may be hesitant to disclose their exploitation out of fear of deportation, if they are undocumented, or arrest. That leads to underreporting.\\n\\nOne way to approximate how many people are being trafficked in the United States is to consult federal grant reports, as suggested by anti-trafficking nonprofit Freedom Network USA.\\n\\nFor example, the federal Office for Victims of Crime served 9,854 total clients – some of whom identified as trafficked, others who showed “strong indicators of trafficking victimization” – between July 2019 and June 2020. The Department of Health and Human Services Office on Trafficking in Persons served 2,398 trafficking survivors during the 2019 fiscal year.\\n\\nData from the same office also shows that 25,597 “potential victims” of sex and labor trafficking were identified through calls to the National Human Trafficking Hotline.\\n\\nAgain, this data is incomplete – if survivors have not accessed these particular resources or called these specific hotlines, they are not represented here.\\n\\nWhat does sex trafficking look like?\\n\\nAs with other sexual crimes, like rape, sex trafficking survivors often experience violence at the hands of someone they know, not a complete stranger.\\n\\nA study from Covenant House New York, a nonprofit focused on homeless youth, found that 36% of the 22 trafficking survivors in their survey were trafficked by an immediate family member, like a parent. Only four reported “being kidnapped and held against his or her will.”\\n\\nOften, trafficking victims are younger transgender people or teens experiencing homelessness who exchange sex with others to meet their basic needs: shelter, economic stability, food and health care. Trafficking frequently looks like vulnerable people struggling to survive in a violent, exploitative world.\\n\\n“They are creating sexual solutions to nonsexual problems,” says San Francisco-based researcher Alexandra Lutnick.\\n\\nUnder U.S. law, these youth are trafficking victims, because of their age. But they may reject the label, preferring terms like “survival sex work” or “prostitution” to describe their experiences.\\n\\nTrafficking victims engaged in survival sex may well be arrested rather than offered help like housing or health care. If they cannot prove “force, fraud, or coercion,” or if they refuse to comply in a criminal investigation, they risk shifting from victim to criminal in the eyes of law enforcement. That can mean prostitution charges, felony offenses or deportation.\\n\\nSuch punishments are most commonly used against Black, Indigenous, queer, trans and undocumented sex-trafficking survivors. Black youth are disproportionately arrested for prostitution offenses, for example, even though legally any underage commercial sex is sex trafficking.\\n\\nWhat Is the Difference Between Sex Work and Sex Trafficking?\\n\\nLegally and in other meaningful ways, sex work and sex trafficking are different.\\n\\nSex work is consenting adults engaging in transactional sex. In almost all U.S. states, it is a criminal offense, punishable with fines and even jail sentences.\\n\\nSex trafficking is nonconsensual, and it is generally treated as a more severe crime.\\n\\nMost sex workers’ groups acknowledge that sex work is not inherently sex trafficking but that sex workers can face force, fraud and coercion because they work in a criminalized, stigmatized profession. Sex workers whose experiences meet the legal standards of trafficking may nonetheless fear disclosing that to police and risking arrest for prostitution.\\n\\nConversely, sex workers can be mistakenly labeled by police and advocates as “trafficked” and find themselves in the custody of law enforcement or social service agencies.\\n\\nWhat can be done?\\n\\nBased on my research, reducing sex trafficking requires changes that might prevent it from occurring in the first place. That means rebuilding a stronger, supportive U.S. social safety net to buffer against poverty and housing insecurity.\\n\\nIn the meantime, trafficking victims would benefit from efforts by frontline workers to combat the racism, sexism and transphobia that stigmatizes and criminalizes victims who don’t look as people expect – and are struggling to survive.\\n\\nCorinne Schwarz is an assistant professor of Gender, Women’s, and Sexuality Studies at Oklahoma State University\\n\\nThis article was originally published in The Conversation.

Hundreds of documents were released in multiple waves in January.\\n\\nEpstein had many high-profile connections, including former U.S. presidents, foreign prime ministers and Britain's Prince Andrew , as well as Hollywood stars, leading academics, people in the modeling and fashion industries and other public figures. Some of the names were previously known through other means despite having been withheld from the public's eye in the lawsuit.\\n\\nMany of the names belong to people who have not been accused of wrongdoing, like former President Bill Clinton, who could have asked the court to have his name remain sealed but declined. A spokesperson for Clinton also denied claims in one of the documents that alleged the former president and Epstein had a \"close personal relationship.\"\\n\\nOther names unsealed included billionaire Glenn Dubin and his former private chef, Rinaldo Rizzo, the magician David Copperfield, Tony Figueroa, Limited Brands founder and former Victoria's Secret CEO Les Wexner, and Epstein accusers such as Johanna Sjoberg and Annie Farmer.\\n\\nJEFFREY EPSTEIN ACCUSER MOCKS ‘NERVOUS’ ASSOCIATES SET TO BE NAMED: ‘WHO’S ON THE NAUGHTY LIST?'\\n\\nDOZENS OF GHISLAINE MAXWELL FILES UNSEALED BY FEDERAL COURT IN SEX TRAFFICKING CASE\\n\\nBill Clinton denies visiting Epstein island in new memoir\\n\\nFormer President Clinton, who had a brief business relationship with Epstein, wrote in his new memoir that he wishes he \"had never met him.\"\\n\\nClinton took flights on Epstein's private jet on trips for the Clinton Foundation. He wrote that they only discussed \"politics and economics\" and that he never traveled to Epstein's infamous Little St. James Island.\\n\\n\"Traveling on Epstein’s plane was not worth the years of questioning afterward,\" he wrote in \"Citizen,\" a new book about his life after leaving the White House.\\n\\nIn a deposition from Epstein accuser Johanna Sjoberg, which was unsealed during the January document dump, she said Epstein bragged about knowing the former president.\\n\\n\"I knew he had dealings with Bill Clinton,\" she said. \"I did not know they were friends until I read the Vanity Fair article about them going to Africa together.\"\\n\\nUnder questioning, she later added, \"He said one time that Clinton likes them young , referring to girls.\"\\n\\nClinton has not been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and spokesperson Angel Urena has denied claims in the documents that Clinton and Epstein had any kind of personal relationship.\\n\\n\"I had always thought Epstein was odd but had no inkling of the crimes he was committing,\" the former president wrote in his book.\\n\\nFormer model recounts Jeffrey Epstein abuse on his private island\\n\\nLisa Phillips, a former model-turned-talent scout and agent, was seeing her career take off when she encountered Jeffrey Epstein.\\n\\nThe former cover girl, who said she was abused by the late convicted sex offender on his private island, recounted her alleged harrowing ordeal on a podcast in October, \" From Now On ,\" aiming to raise awareness of human trafficking and how it can impact anyone.\\n\\nOn a free day after a photo shoot in the Virgin Islands, another model invited her to visit Epstein's private island, Little St. James.\\n\\nEpstein asked her for a massage, then slowly escalated the situation into an outright sex assault, she said.\\n\\nJEFFREY EPSTEIN VICTIMS SUE FBI FOR ALLEGED FAILURE TO INVESTIGATE ‘SEX TRAFFICKING RING FOR THE ELITE’\\n\\n\"It wasn’t a straight, ‘Let me pull you into a room and abuse you,’\" Phillips recalled. \"He eases into things, like, ‘It’s just a massage, right?’ The girl went along with it and brought me into the room to do this massage with him. It was a slow thing that escalated into abuse. The whole process was very confusing to me.\"\\n\\nOver the years, she's met other victims who were attacked in the same way, she said.\\n\\n\"I was on an island,\" she said. \"I wasn’t in a house where I could say, ‘Excuse me, I need to leave,’ and grab my stuff. I was far away from home on an island I should never have been on.\"\\n\\nEpstein grand jury records released\\n\\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a new anti-trafficking law that cleared the way for state investigators to release confidential grand jury records from the slap-on-the-wrist punishment Epstein received for child sex trafficking in the 2000s. Hours after the law took effect, Palm Beach County Court Clerk and Comptroller Joseph Abruzzo announced the release.\\n\\nFLORIDA GOV RON DESANTIS SIGNS LAW WITH BIG POTENTIAL IMPACT ON EPSTEIN CASE\\n\\nPalm Beach police initially opened the case after a fight between girls at a local high school, according to the transcripts. One, just 16, had been accused of prostitution by a classmate, and a school official later found $300 in her purse, which originally came from Epstein.\\n\\nShe testified that she had been instructed to concoct a fake life story and pretend to be 18 to get $200 to give Epstein a massage before the first time she met him. Then she revealed she was asked to strip down to her underwear and had a graphic sexual encounter with him.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nIn a court order authorizing the release of the documents, Circuit Judge Luis Delgado warned that the contents were disturbing.\\n\\n\"It is widely accepted that Epstein is a notorious and serial pedophile,\" the order reads. \"The testimony taken by the Grand Jury concerns activity ranging from grossly unacceptable to rape – all of the conduct at issue is sexually deviant, disgusting, and criminal. The details in the record will be outrageous to decent people.\"\\n\\nFox News' Stephanie Nolasco contributed to this report."}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.714837Z", "updated_at":

(WDAM) - A nearly one-year-old investigation into a sex trafficking ring in Jasper County is coming to a close.\\n\\n“It’s heartbreaking,” Jasper County Sheriff Randy Johnson said Friday. “That’s when you hope it’s a special place in hell for people like this.”\\n\\nJohnson said he was contacted in January with allegations of child abuse made against then-35-year-old Christopher Lowe.\\n\\n“A jailer that was working here called me about concerns regarding a minor child, and the way she had heard, the child had been treated,” said Johnson.\\n\\nAccording to Johnson, the Jasper County Department of Human Services later found that Lowe had been receiving methamphetamine from several people in exchange for sex with the 15-year-old.\\n\\nThe sheriff added that the situation spanned nearly two years.\\n\\nA total of seven people, all from Jasper County, were arrested on charges ranging from human trafficking to sexual battery.\\n\\n“We arrested seven throughout this whole deal, and five have come to terms with the court,” Johnson said. “Two have yet to come to terms.”\\n\\nSeveral have been either released, sent back to prison or are awaiting trial.\\n\\nLowe pleaded guilty and received a sentence of 22 years in prison, contingent on his testimony at the final. two trials.\\n\\nJohnson said he believes the situation speaks to a larger issue within the county.\\n\\n“Quite often, the child doesn’t come forward,” said Johnson. “Like in this case, it was given to me through a third party.\\n\\n“Actually, it wasn’t third party. It was probably fourth or fifth party.”\\n\\nJohnson said the child has been placed into a new home, but recovering from this sort of trauma likely will take years of counseling.\\n\\n“Protective services in Jasper County has done a great job with this,” said Johnson. “They’ve been with us every step of the way.\\n\\n“They handle the children, as far as placement and trying to help them get through this.”\\n\\nBrothers Kevin and Tajik Page were the final two arrested in the investigation.\\n\\nBoth men were charged with human trafficking and sexual battery and will stand trial in March.\\n\\nWant more WDAM 7 news in your inbox?

Kyle Mecouch received contact from a woman in Galeton, Pennsylvania, who said her 15-year-old daughter had been in an online relationship with a person she had believed to be a teenager.\\n\\nOn the day prior, the girl approached her mother and was upset she had lost contact with a \"teenager\" she had been talking to, police said. The teen admitted Romig's true identity — a 29-year-old man — and said she had been unable to contact him since Dec. 12, the day of his initial arrest.\\n\\nAfter learning of Romig's true identity, the mother searched his name on the internet and came across the Cumberland County Prosecutor's Office's Dec. 13 news release about his arrest, police said.\\n\\nRomig is alleged to have randomly added the 15-year-old girl as a friend on Snapchat in December 2022, police said. He initially told the girl his name was \"Jason\" and that he was 17.\\n\\nBoth began to talk daily on Snapchat and other online platforms. During that time, Romig is alleged to have sent nude photographs of himself and requested the victim send him sexually explicit photos and videos.\\n\\nRomig eventually told the victim his real age and name and convinced her to not tell her parents about him, police said. They continued to talk daily until Romig's arrest Dec. 12. After not being able to contact him, the victim told her parents, police said.\\n\\nRomig continues to be held in the Cumberland County jail.

Du Wen, once the executive director of the Legal Advisory Office for Inner Mongolia, has exposed the Chinese Communist Party’s systematic involvement in this brutal practice—a grim reality he witnessed firsthand during his wrongful 12-year imprisonment.\\n\\nDu’s account paints a chilling picture of a system where organ harvesting operates in plain sight. He recalls advertisements for organ transplants outside prominent Beijing hospitals and claims that, for the right price, individuals can arrange for a live person to be captured and stripped of their organs. This isn’t just a black-market operation—it’s an organized network with ties to the state, with transactions openly taking place since the 1990s.\\n\\nA former Chinese official has come forward to confirm the communist regime’s crime of forced organ harvesting based on his own experience in China.

These individuals, imprisoned for their beliefs, have been systematically targeted for their organs. The 2019 findings of the London-based China Tribunal corroborate Du’s testimony. The tribunal’s extensive investigation concluded that prisoners of conscience, especially Falun Gong practitioners, have been killed for their organs on a large scale.\\n\\nThis practice is not a relic of the past—it continues to this day. The international community has long condemned forced organ harvesting, but these new details underscore the urgent need for action. Du’s revelations serve as a stark reminder of the CCP’s alleged human rights abuses, raising the question: How much longer can the world look away?\\n\\nSources:\\n\\nhttps://www.theepochtimes.com/china/former-chinese-official-confirms-reality-of-forced-organ-harvesting-5782020?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=ettwitter\\n\\nhttps://www.ntd.com/former-chinese-official-confirms-reality-of-forced-organ-harvesting_1036964.html\\n\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_harvesting_from_Falun_Gong_practitioners_in_China\\n\\nhttps://chrissmith.house.gov/uploadedfiles/2022-05-12_organ_harvesting_hearing_opening_remarks.pdf"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.714934Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-14T16:28:55.146818Z", "inner_id": 212, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60832, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 144951507, "annotations": [{"id": 54586946, "completed_by": {"id": 60833, "email": "sskanuk@gmail.com", "first_name": "", "last_name": ""}, "result": [{"id": "tfB5NkhY_E", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Incident"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}, {"id": "Ele2Tchz3Y", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Minor", "Sexual Abuse"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "coercion_classifier"}, {"id": "suqJIA2gYJ", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "recruitment_classifier"}, {"id": "IsDwDoKRbv", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "transport_classifier"}, {"id": "0tsJso-ZOK", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Child Sexual Exploitation", "Sexual Exploitation"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_classifier"}, {"id": "e7DKfH3gxF", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_sub_classifier"}], "reviews": [], "history": [{"id": 59791088, "comment": null, "organization_id": 34950, "project_id": 122257, "annotation_id": 54586946, "draft_id": null, "review_id": null, "task_id": 144951507, "result": [{"id": "tfB5NkhY_E", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Incident"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}, {"id": "Ele2Tchz3Y", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Minor", "Sexual Abuse"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "coercion_classifier"}, {"id": "suqJIA2gYJ", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "recruitment_classifier"}, {"id": "IsDwDoKRbv", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "transport_classifier"}, {"id": "0tsJso-ZOK", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Child Sexual Exploitation", "Sexual Exploitation"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_classifier"}, {"id": "e7DKfH3gxF", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_sub_classifier"}], "lead_time": 20.103, "action": "submitted", "started_at": "2025-02-16T22:48:04.662000Z", "created_at": "2025-02-16T22:48:25.241539Z", "created_by": 60833, "comment_id": null}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-16T22:48:25.087272Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-16T22:48:25.087282Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-02-16T22:48:15.083651Z", "lead_time": 20.103, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 6, "unique_id": "51f2845f-b1e4-44cc-b649-971535394f55", "import_id": null, "last_action": "submitted", "bulk_created": false, "task": 144951507, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60833, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": 60833}], "file_upload": "2d869759-batch_5_data.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "agreement": 100.0, "data": {"_id": {"$oid": "67720c7a351814a79e98108a"}, "text": "In Hull, England, the month of December saw a number of criminals locked up for heinous crimes.

A recent independent review into the actions of John Smyth, a prolific abuser linked to the Church of England, revealed a pattern of cover-up and failure to report his crimes, which spanned England, South Africa, and Zimbabwe. Smyth, who died in 2018, allegedly abused over 100 boys, including the suspicious death of a 16-year-old in Zimbabwe in 1992.\\n\\nThe article highlights the experiences of a former student at a Jesuit-run Catholic school in Zimbabwe, who details widespread rumors and allegations of abuse involving several priests. Research for a novel on the topic uncovered accounts of horrific abuse at St. Ignatius of Loyola, St. George’s College, and St. Francis Xavier, with at least three priests frequently named. The Catholic Church is accused of moving these priests to different locations to avoid accountability. Only one, James Chaning-Pearce, has been convicted, following his identification by a former student in Australia and subsequent extradition from there to England.\\n\\nThe author argues that the churches’ apologies and commitments to change, primarily focused on Western victims, are insufficient. The article calls for full inquiries into historical sexual abuse at schools across Africa, demanding accountability for the suffering of African victims, many from impoverished backgrounds who saw these prestigious schools as their only chance for advancement. The author concludes that failure to address this issue would demonstrate that the churches value the lives of white victims far more than those of Black Africans.\\n\\nRead More"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.714983Z", "updated_at": "2025-01-29T14:41:36.405646Z", "inner_id": 215, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60832, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 144951510, "annotations": [{"id": 53571918, "completed_by": {"id": 60832, "email": "iorwuesesolomon@gmail.com", "first_name": "Fanen", "last_name": "Iorwuese"}, "result": [{"id": "LEijYDCR5b", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Article"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}, {"id": "iuO7gF4JbT", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Physical Abuse/Threat or force", "Psychological Abuse/Threat or Force", "Sexual Abuse"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "coercion_classifier"}, {"id": "2IXW7FXCHz", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "recruitment_classifier"}, {"id": "ujfL4DqF0E", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "transport_classifier"}, {"id": "W-e4VLo5jY", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Child Sexual Exploitation"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_classifier"}, {"id": "sdvSHdf1sY", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Personal Sexual Servitude", "Prostitution/Brothel/Escort Agency"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_sub_classifier"}], "reviews": [], "history": [{"id": 58598063, "comment": null, "organization_id": 34950, "project_id": 122257, "annotation_id": 53571918, "draft_id": null, "review_id": null, "task_id": 144951510, "result": [{"id": "LEijYDCR5b", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Article"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}, {"id": "iuO7gF4JbT", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Physical Abuse/Threat or force", "Psychological Abuse/Threat or Force", "Sexual Abuse"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "coercion_classifier"}, {"id": "2IXW7FXCHz", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "recruitment_classifier"}, {"id": "ujfL4DqF0E", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "transport_classifier"}, {"id": "W-e4VLo5jY", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Child Sexual Exploitation"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_classifier"}, {"id": "sdvSHdf1sY", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Personal Sexual Servitude", "Prostitution/Brothel/Escort Agency"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_sub_classifier"}], "lead_time": 53.898, "action": "submitted", "started_at": "2025-01-29T14:41:35.115000Z", "created_at": "2025-01-29T14:42:31.545310Z", "created_by": 60832, "comment_id": null}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-01-29T14:42:31.362728Z", "updated_at": "2025-01-29T14:42:31.362745Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-01-29T14:42:01.293677Z", "lead_time": 53.898, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 6, "unique_id": "90afd4df-d450-480a-8bd6-7b4980d1139e", "import_id": null, "last_action": "submitted", "bulk_created": false, "task": 144951510, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60832, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": 60832}], "file_upload": "2d869759-batch_5_data.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "agreement": 100.0, "data": {"_id": {"$oid": "67720c7a351814a79e981057"}, "text": "*This article contains descriptions of child sexual abuse and molestation that may be distressing to some readers.

Similarly, Ashcroft allegedly placed his hand on another student’s chest for “a couple of seconds”.\\n\\nThe student phoned her mother when a teacher noticed her crying and took her to the deputy principal to report the incident.\\n\\nWhile three additional claims of inappropriate thigh-touching were initially brought forward by other students, Ashcroft was acquitted of those charges. However, the Crown used these testimonies as “tendency evidence”, indicating a pattern of grossly inappropriate behaviour towards students.\\n\\nDistrict Judge Alister Abadee strongly upheld the two convictions, deeming Ashcroft\\n\\n“sexually interested in teenage schoolgirls with an associated tendency to opportunistically act on it”.\\n\\nAshcroft’s defense argued the incidents were simply accidental or non-sexual.\\n\\nHowever, Judge Abadee found the pattern of behavior condemning , suggesting the three earlier thigh-touching incidents “manifested a tendency” , proving the former school principal ‘s intent in violating the latter students.\\n\\nAshcroft will now serve a two years and eight months community corrections order, including supervision and 200 hours of community

vulnerable sections of society.\\n\\nAdvertisment\\n\\nThe scale of online child sexual exploitation is not just statistics but a profound human tragedy inflicted on children that demands a unified global response to protect them from the perpetrators.\\n\\nMore than 300 million children across the globe are victims of online sexual exploitation and abuse each year, according to research by the University of Edinburgh, which found that 12.6% of the world’s children have been victims of nonconsensual talking, sharing, and exposure to sexual images and video in 2023.\\n\\nThis staggering figure highlights the pervasiveness of this crime and the far-reaching impact that is often hidden behind closed digital doors.\\n\\nAdvertisment\\n\\nFor many, statistics are just numbers-difficult to comprehend and easier to ignore. But behind every number is a story.\\n\\nOffences can also take the form of “sextortion”, where predators demand money from victims to keep images private, and abuse of AI deepfake technology.\\n\\nWith few clicks, the predators share explicit content, trade information, and operate with precision to target children across the continents for money. Yet, the global response to stop them remains fragmented and inadequate.\\n\\nAdvertisment\\n\\nThe alarming unity among perpetrators makes the absence of a coordinated global response all the more concerning.\\n\\nCall to action\\n\\nThe world is waking up to this grim reality as reflected in the recently held ‘WeProtect’ two-day Abu Dhabi Global Summit-2024 which marked the launch of the ‘Abu Dhabi Call to Action’, a unified initiative to address current and emerging challenges in child protection within the digital world.\\n\\nAdvertisment\\n\\nUnder the theme ‘Focus on the Future’, the Global Summit saw the participation of over 600 stakeholders to discuss and take pre-emptive action on critical technology trends that will impact online child safety over the next 5-10 years.\\n\\nThe push came from the stakeholders from India who called for urgency in addressing the issue as they raised concerns about the growing digital penetration with over 900 million internet users, among whom children may inadvertently fall prey to Child Sexual Exploitative Abuse Material (CSEAM) delivered online.\\n\\nThis digital proliferation creates unprecedented risks, and forces of vulnerability, transforming the internet from a tool of connection and learning into a potential hunting ground for predators.\\n\\nAdvertisment\\n\\nWith ‘new narrative and lessons from India’, Bhuwan Ribhu, as child rights activist and founder ‘Just Rights for Children’ (JRC), a network of over 250 NGOs operating across 416 districts in India, led the conversation by acknowledging India’s efforts to combat child pornography.\\n\\nPertinently, it was on JRC’s Public Interest Litigation that the Supreme Court delivered its landmark ruling in September 2024 wherein the apex court criminalized not only the production of child pornography but also its downloading and storage.\\n\\n\"We need an international database with a globally binding instrument to share data and information about sex offenders across borders. These online criminals are organized and coordinated, so our response must be equally organized,” stressed Bhuwan Ribhu, whose words cut to the heart of a global challenge that transcends borders, cultures, and technological boundaries.\\n\\nAdvertisment\\n\\nThe call for an international database is not merely an idea—it is a necessity. A centralized system that tracks sex offenders globally, shares information across borders and holds perpetrators accountable irrespective of their location can act as a powerful deterrent.\\n\\nSuch a system could create unprecedented transparency, allowing law enforcement agencies to track and prevent potential abuses across national boundaries.\\n\\nInternational collaboration emerged as the most critical strategy at the Summit to combat this global menace.\\n\\nAdvertisment\\n\\nBridging jurisdictional gaps\\n\\nJurisdictional boundaries limit law enforcement agencies, and the lack of a centralized, universally binding database allows offenders to exploit these gaps.\\n\\nWhile countries like the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom have implemented advanced tracking and monitoring systems for sex offenders. Yet, these systems are confined to national boundaries. The lack of a global framework allows offenders to relocate and continue their activities without fear of repercussions.\\n\\nAn internationally binding instrument could bridge these gaps. Such an instrument would require nations to share information, adopt uniform legal frameworks, prioritize and protect children over jurisdictional disputes, and empower countries to act swiftly and decisively.\\n\\nTechnology as a force for good\\n\\nIn this given scenario, technology companies have a significant role to play. Advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning are powerful tools for detecting and preventing online child sexual exploitation. Proactive monitoring, rapid reporting mechanisms, and strict content moderation policies will be essential in creating safer digital spaces.\\n\\nSimilarly, evolving legal frameworks must continue to adapt to the rapidly changing digital landscape.\\n\\nCyber laws need to be dynamic, addressing emerging technologies and methods used by perpetrators.\\n\\nThis requires ongoing collaboration between technology experts, legal professionals, child psychologists, and law enforcement agencies.\\n\\nFollowing public scrutiny and coordinated action against CEO Pavel Durov, Telegram banned more than 700,000 channels and groups sharing content related to child sexual exploitation in the app. Telegram also joined the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), a global body with legal power to proactively seek out and remove images or videos of child sexual abuse. Now, it uses machine learning-powered systems that allow users to report content proactively on the platform. These measures show that when tech companies take responsibility, they can make a significant difference.\\n\\nA shared responsibility\\n\\nThe fight against online child sexual abuse is daunting, but it is not unwinnable. It requires a multi-pronged approach involving governments, tech companies, law enforcement, educators, and civil society.\\n\\nThis isn’t just about passing stronger laws or building better tools. It’s about protecting childhood and the trust that every child deserves. It’s about standing up to a global network of abusers with an equally powerful network of protectors.\\n\\nThe global community must unite, driven by a shared commitment to protect the most vulnerable. Every step brings us closer to a just world where children can navigate the digital space without fear of transnational economic and organized online criminals."}, "meta": {}, "created_at":

As a prominent researcher and advocate for child protection in India, your insights are invaluable during this arduous time. Recent weeks have seen a string of horrific cases of child sexual assault, including the shocking incident in Basti where a three year old girl was allegedly raped by a group of individuals, some even younger than ten. What are your initial thoughts on this disturbing trend?**dr. Sharma:** It’s truly heartbreaking. These cases are a stark reminder of the horrific reality many children in india face.The Basti case is particularly appalling, not just as of the brutality but becuase it highlights the complex societal factors contributing to this issue. The involvement of young children as perpetrators is a disturbing symptom of a deeper problem – a cycle of violence and a lack of proper support systems for children.**Archyde:** You mentioned societal factors. Can you elaborate on what you mean?**dr.Sharma:** There are many contributing factors. Poverty, lack of education, a culture of silence surrounding sexual abuse, and inadequate law enforcement all play a role. Furthermore, India’s patriarchal society often perpetuates harmful gender norms that can make children, particularly girls, vulnerable to abuse.**Archyde:** There have been horrific incidents recorded even in childcare centers, supposed places of safety. what needs to be done to ensure that children are protected,not just at home,but in institutions designed to care for them?**Dr. Sharma:** This underscores the dire need for stricter regulations and oversight of childcare centers. Staff needs to be thoroughly vetted, and training on child protection and abuse prevention must be mandatory. It’s also crucial to create an habitat where children feel safe to speak up about abuse without fear of retribution.**Archyde:** What are some concrete steps that the government and civil society can take to tackle this crisis?**Dr. Sharma:** Firstly, we need thorough legislation that ensures swift and effective justice for victims and punishment for perpetrators. Second, there needs to be a national awareness campaign to break the silence surrounding child sexual abuse and educate communities about prevention and reporting.Third, we must invest in robust child protection services and counselling for both survivors and perpetrators. This includes providing comprehensive support to victims and their families, as well as rehabilitation programs for perpetrators to address the underlying causes of their actions.**Archyde:** what message would you like to send to the parents and guardians of children in India?**Dr. Sharma:** Please be vigilant. Talk to your children about good touch and bad touch. Create a safe space for them to share their experiences and always believe them when they speak out. Remember, every child deserves a safe and nurturing environment, and we must all work together to ensure that happens.**Archyde:** Thank you, Dr. Sharma, for your insights and for your tireless work in advocating for children’s rights.Your voice is an important one in this fight."}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.715137Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-04T16:46:12.441473Z", "inner_id": 224, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60834, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 144951519, "annotations": [{"id": 53857070, "completed_by": {"id": 60834, "email": "ankitamanna1@gmail.com", "first_name": "", "last_name": ""}, "result": [{"id": "m3BJ9nvlWj", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Incident"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}, {"id": "GzeRt2SwEv", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Minor", "Sexual Abuse"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "coercion_classifier"}, {"id": "QJDN_wVzL-", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "recruitment_classifier"}, {"id": "07rxC4cj2s", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "transport_classifier"}, {"id": "ATNcn-a3-4", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Child Sexual Exploitation", "Sexual Exploitation"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_classifier"}, {"id": "lGcH6imq31", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Online Sexual Exploitation", "Pornography"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_sub_classifier"}], "reviews": [], "history": [{"id": 58949685, "comment": null, "organization_id": 34950, "project_id": 122257, "annotation_id": 53857070, "draft_id": null, "review_id": null, "task_id": 144951519, "result": [{"id": "m3BJ9nvlWj", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Incident"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}, {"id": "GzeRt2SwEv", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Minor", "Sexual Abuse"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "coercion_classifier"}, {"id": "QJDN_wVzL-", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "recruitment_classifier"}, {"id": "07rxC4cj2s", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["ABSTAIN"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "transport_classifier"}, {"id": "ATNcn-a3-4", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Child Sexual Exploitation", "Sexual Exploitation"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_classifier"}, {"id": "lGcH6imq31", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Online Sexual Exploitation", "Pornography"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "trafficking_type_sub_classifier"}], "lead_time": 99.931, "action": "submitted", "started_at": "2025-02-04T16:46:13.607000Z", "created_at": "2025-02-04T16:47:53.256504Z", "created_by": 60834, "comment_id": null}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-04T16:47:53.142431Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-04T16:47:53.142441Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-02-04T16:46:43.441959Z", "lead_time": 99.931, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 6, "unique_id": "a06f84b4-efbf-4df5-9994-bcfdb6a78da6", "import_id": null, "last_action": "submitted", "bulk_created": false, "task": 144951519, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60834, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": 60834}], "file_upload": "2d869759-batch_5_data.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "agreement": 100.0, "data": {"_id": {"$oid": "67720c7a351814a79e980ffd"}, "text": "PornHub Goes to Trial for Allegations of Distributing Teen Abuse Video\\n\\nBy Movieguide® Contributor\\n\\nPornography website PornHub is being sued for allegedly exploiting the filmed rape and abuse of a 16-year-old girl and profiting from it.\\n\\n“In an Order issued on Thursday the Federal Court in Alabama denied Pornhub’s motion for summary judgment and ruled that the pornography giant must face trial on claims of sex trafficking and possessing, creating, and distributing child sexual abuse material (CSAM),” the National Center on Sexual Exploitation reported.\\n\\nPornHub stated that it is “immune from liability” because of Section 230, which allows websites “to carry the speech of individuals without risking significant legal liability for the content of the speakers.” However, the court denied that this situation fell under this protection, and the lawsuit will go to trial.\\n\\n“CSAM, by contrast, is itself a violent crime, a record of that crime, and contraband — not information.

Hernandez has convictions for third degree sexual abuse among other charges.\\n\\nFugitive operations officers arrested the 42-year-old sexual predator outside a residence in Brooklyn. He is currently in ERO custody pending removal proceedings.\\n\\n“We will not tolerate predators taking advantage of public services such as the MTA to violate women and girls,” said ERO New York City Field Office Director Kenneth Genalo. “ERO officers will find these criminal noncitizens and seek their removal from the United States.”\\n\\nThe U.S. Border Patrol arrested Hernandez following three separate attempts to unlawfully enter the U.S. near Nogales, Arizona, between Jan. 7 and Jan. 9, 2003. Hernandez voluntarily returned to Mexico on each occasion but later unlawfully entered the U.S. on an unknown date and location without admission by an immigration official.\\n\\nThe New York Police Department arrested Hernandez Jan. 13, 2023, for third degree sexual abuse and other charges. The Queens County Criminal Court in Kew Gardens convicted Hernandez of those charges May 30. The victim in this case was a 15-year-old girl.\\n\\nHernandez was arrested again on sex abuse charges by the NYPD Nov. 17, 2023. The Kings County Criminal Court in Brooklyn convicted him On June 12 on those charges and sentenced him to one year probation with conditional discharge and required him to register as a sex offender. The victim in this case was a 40-year-old woman.\\n\\nNoncitizens placed into removal proceedings receive their legal due process from federal immigration judges in the immigration courts, which are administered by the Executive Office for Immigration Review. The Executive Office for Immigration Review is an agency within the U.S. Department of Justice and is separate from the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Immigration judges in these courts make decisions based on the merits of each individual case. ERO officers carry out the removal decisions made by the federal immigration judges.\\n\\nERO is one of ICE’s three operational directorates and is the principal federal law enforcement authority in charge of domestic immigration enforcement. ERO’s mission is to protect the homeland through the arrest and removal of those who undermine the safety of U.S. communities and the integrity of U.S. immigration laws, and its primary areas of focus are interior enforcement operations, management of the agency’s detained and non-detained populations, and repatriation of noncitizens who have received final orders of removal.\\n\\nMembers of the public can report crimes and suspicious activity by dialing 866-347-2423 or completing ICE’s online tip form."}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.715825Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-16T23:16:20.024344Z", "inner_id": 262, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60833, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 144951557, "annotations": [{"id": 54587093, "completed_by": {"id": 60833, "email": "sskanuk@gmail.com", "first_name": "", "last_name": ""}, "result": [{"id": "ZbXFLEWZin", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Irrelevant"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}], "reviews": [], "history": [{"id": 59791244, "comment": null, "organization_id": 34950, "project_id": 122257, "annotation_id": 54587093, "draft_id": null, "review_id": null, "task_id": 144951557, "result": [{"id": "ZbXFLEWZin", "type": "choices", "value": {"choices": ["Irrelevant"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "incident_classifier"}], "lead_time": 6.927, "action": "submitted", "started_at": "2025-02-16T23:19:05.845000Z", "created_at": "2025-02-16T23:19:13.183752Z", "created_by": 60833, "comment_id": null}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-16T23:19:13.074666Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-16T23:19:13.074676Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 6.927, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "b02ee711-30ef-417b-8997-49b5eec0a5b0", "import_id": null, "last_action": "submitted", "bulk_created": false, "task": 144951557, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60833, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": 60833}], "file_upload": "2d869759-batch_5_data.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "agreement": 100.0, "data": {"_id": {"$oid": "6773584a4dacd25cbab926ef"}, "text": "The passengers had spent three days at sea when three traffickers– who were assigned to maintaining order onboard– decided to punish some of the asylum seekers read more\\n\\nA 'cayuco' boat with 57 migrants onboard arrives at La Restinga port on the Canary island of El Hierro, on September 14, 2024.

England]\\n\\n\\n\\nDecember 28, 2024\\n\\nBy Alexander Faludy\\n\\nFr András Pajor, a prominent advocate of the ruling Fidesz party’s “political Christianity”, was accused of abuse by former altar boys.\\n\\nThe sexual abuse crisis gripping the Catholic Church in Hungary has expanded to include the Archdiocese of Esztergom-Budapest, headed by the Hungarian primate Cardinal Péter Erdő.\\n\\nAttention previously focused on a wave of suspensions and prosecutions of priests in the Archdiocese of Kalocsa-Kecskemét, which emerged over the autumn. But on 5 December, news broke of canonical and police investigations into Fr András Pajor, a priest in Budapest.\\n\\nFr Pajor is a prominent advocate of the ruling Fidesz party’s “political Christianity”. In 2023 he received Hungary’s Knight’s Cross of the Order of Merit for his “role in youth education”.\\n\\nPajor has long urged Christians to vote for the governing Fidesz-KDNP alliance. More recently, he has also become notable as a spreader of Russian propaganda, claiming in a YouTube video about the Ukraine war that since 2022 some 35,000 Russian children had been kidnapped “for paedophiles in the West”.\\n\\nFormer altar boys from Pajors’ parish, however, have told a different story. Speaking anonymously to independent Hungarian outlet Válasz Online, they claimed he frequently made them strip naked, inspected their genitals intimately with his hands and gave them full body massages.\\n\\nThe priest was identified by Válasz after the Archdiocese of Esztergom-Budapest released a statement noting a complaint against an unamed priest in the capital. The statement reported that the cleric had been suspended from parochial ministry while under investigation. Further, it reported, Cardinal Erdő “subsequently dismissed the parish priest concerned from his ecclesiastical duties and retired him”.\\n\\nIt said the latter measure was at the priest’s “own request, on account of his age and state of health”.\\n\\nObservers welcomed this evidence of swift internal action by the archdiocese, and the referral to secular authorities, as a sign of improved practice. Some, however, were concerned by the tone of church communications.\\n\\nA statement from the Hungarian bishops’ conference on 4 December acknowledged a need to repent “for sins committed” but offered victims no direct apology.\\n\\nThe statement also struck a defensive tone. “News reports of sexual offences against children indicate that they are present in many sectors of society, but often give the impression that they are committed only by clergy,” it claimed.\\n\\nhttps://www.thetablet.co.uk/news/hungarian-abuse-scandal-extends-to-cardinals-diocese/"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-01-21T19:43:17.715941Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-16T23:23:37.388096Z", "inner_id": 269, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 122257, "updated_by": 60833, "comment_authors": []}]
